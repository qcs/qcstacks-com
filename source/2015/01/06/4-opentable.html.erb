Orchids at Palm Court ranked in Open Table’s Top 100 Restaurants in American. The Hilton Netherland Plaza Hotel-based restaurant was chosen because it exemplified “creativity, consistency and hospitality.” Red Feather in Oakley and Bistro Grace in North Side were also chosen by Open Table as its Top 100 Neighborhood Gem Restaurants in America.

A New Year means new parking meters. If youâ€™re looking to park at a meter in Over-the-Rhine, you might see one of the 500 new meters with adjusted rates and hours. The new meters can accept credit cards and also a pay-by-phone feature that will be implemented soon. The parking rates in Over-the-Rhine have doubled to $1/hour.

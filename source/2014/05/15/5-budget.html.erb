Before the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1st, the city is required to pass a new budget and Mayor John Cranley has just released his plans to do so. According to the administration, his is the first balanced budget in more than a decade &mdash; that is, for every dollar spent, another dollar is cut. Further, the new budget hasn't proposed any layoffs or raised any taxes and also manages to close a $22MM budget gap. The only catch? It relies on a favorable federal judgement of the current mediation between the City and municipal employees.

After taking office as Hamilton County Sheriff back in 2013, Jim Neil ordered an audit of his department to help find efficiencies and processes that could be streamlined. The result of that effort has concluded and the HCSO says its key areas of concern are pretty much what you'd expect: staffing, technology, and training. While the report contains praise for the officers it also states that they are resistant to change.

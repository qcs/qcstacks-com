Memorial day is right around the corner and as is customary in Queen City, so is the Taste of Cincinnati. This year marks the 36th anniversary of the edible event which kicks off on Saturday May 24th. Besides longer hours, organizers have announced that there will be more vendors this year than ever before. Last year, more than half a million hungry foodies were part of the feast.

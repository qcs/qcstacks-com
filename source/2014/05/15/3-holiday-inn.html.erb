Thanks to a more positive financial outlook, City Council has approved two ordinances that relax some requirements on developers and paves the way for a new Holiday Inn to be built on the corner of 7th and Broadway Streets. Business Courier reports that the ordinances revise a development agreement from 2011 in a number of ways, most notably, removing a reference to the funding source of a new garage on Sycamore. Council has agreed that the city should pay for the new garage but has no idea how do that.

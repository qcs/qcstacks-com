Protesters are expected to gather downtown today to rally against the new teacher contract put forth by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati that prohibits teachers and employees from living in the 21st century. The contact prohibits participating in or supporting gay lifestyles and out of wedlock sexual relationships. The contract came after teacher Carla Dias was awarded more than $170,000 after she was fired because she used artificial insemination. Mike Moroski, the former principal at Purcell Marian, was also fired last year after he wrote on his personal blog that he supported same-sex marriage.

As Cincinnati city planners and transportation officials discuss rehabilitation or replacement of the Western Hills Viaduct, some residents are voicing their desire to include light rail in the plan. WVXU reports that the additional transit lines for rail could add approximately $50 million to the project but would help to connect more than 20% of the city's residents to the urban core.

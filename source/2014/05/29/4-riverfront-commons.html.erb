Not to be outdone by big brother's recent developments along the river, Covington is looking to up it's game with big plans for KY's most picturesque, waterside real estate. City officials want to transform the south-side of the riverbank into a "waterfront activity center" with walkable trails, recreational pavilions and more under a new project that's being dubbed Riverfront Commons. The plan calls for development from the Purple People Bridge in Newport to Devou Park in Covington and will hopefully be funded in part by grants from the US Department of Transportation.

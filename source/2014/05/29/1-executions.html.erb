The Columbus Dispatch reports today that a Federal Judge has placed a moratorium on future executions by lethal injection in the state until he can learn more about the new drugs being used. Following last month’s botched execution of Dennis McGuire, in which the inmate was seen visibly gasping and choking, states are scrambling to come up a process to ensure that future efforts do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly since that controversial incident, a number of court challenges have been filed against the state alleging a violation of inmate’s constitutional rights.

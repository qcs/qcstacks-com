Thanks to regional cooperation, the Greater Cincinnati area was awarded a federal designation this week which should result in better opportunities for regional development efforts. The designation comes due in part to the 'aerospace corridor', the aerial traffic lane which runs between NKY and Dayton, OH and should not only give the region preferential treatment on federal grant applications over the next two years but will also appropriate a federal liaison to help with the complicated process of applying for future grants.

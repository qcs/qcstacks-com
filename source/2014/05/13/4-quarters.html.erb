Now that&rsquo;s a long con. City employee Marc Corsmeier pleaded guilty to stealing nearly $20 thousand in quarters from city parking meters during an 8-year period. Corsmeier stole about $50 per week after starting on the job in 2007. Another city employee noticed coins in the bottom of Corsmeier&rsquo;s gym bag and contacted police who confiscated the gym bag and found the stolen quarters. Corsmeier has been placed on probation for three years and is prevented from working for the public again.

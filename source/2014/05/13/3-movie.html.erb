Don Cheadle is set to shoot his upcoming biopic about Miles Davis in Cincinnati, proving that the city continues to be a destination for filmmakers. The announcement came just 10 days after &ldquo;Carol&rdquo; wrapped. Cheadle&rsquo;s movie, &ldquo;Miles Ahead,&rdquo; will portray Cincinnati as New York City where Miles Davis primarily lived and recorded.

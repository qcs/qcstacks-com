The much maligned teacher contract put forth by the Cincinnati Archdiocese won&rsquo;t be changing any time soon. The contract includes a stipulation that prevents employees from supporting issues that run counter to Catholic teaching such as homosexuality, in vitro fertilization, living together outside of wedlock and other positions are not based in the 1800s. According to the superintendent of the Archdiocese fewer than six teachers have refused to sign the contract. The Archdiocese controls 113 schools in 19 counties.

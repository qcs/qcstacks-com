After two years at U.S. Bank Arena the Crosstown Shootout between the University of Cincinnati Bearcats and Xavier University Musketeers will be returning to campus arenas. The two-year hiatus for the annual game was prompted by a fight in 2011 at the Cintas Center at Xavier. The first game back on campus will take place Feb. 18 at UC&rsquo;s Fifth Third Area with Xavier will hosting the game Dec. 12, 2015.

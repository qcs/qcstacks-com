Anybody who appreciates good craft beer knows the name Stone Brewing. So it's not surprising that WCPO's latest report about the Escondido based brewery possibly considering Cincinnati as a hub for it's expansion to the East coast has the adult-beverage crowd swooning. If it becomes reality, the latest addition to the city's brew-culture could add 374 jobs and thousands of gallons of flowing, sudsy refreshment. Cheers, indeed!

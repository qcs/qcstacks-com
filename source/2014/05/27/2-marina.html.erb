The city of Dayton, KY has agreed to sell the Manhattan Harbour marina to a developer who is planning a $400MM development, and hopes to rebuild the riverfront replete with restaurants, retail and more than 40 residential homes. Developer David Imoboden, who has been working on this project for some time, plans to rename the marina the Manhattan Harbour Yacht Club but will continue normal operations after he takes ownership in July.

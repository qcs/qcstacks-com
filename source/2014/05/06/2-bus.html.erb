Almost 100 bus drivers and other workers who are employed by MV Transportation my go on strike this week after their employer submitted their final contract offer the employees this week. The union representing the bus drivers is opposing a two-tiered wage system that would have employees pay 25 percent of their health care costs. MV Transportation is looking to cut wages because Metro wanted to save $500,000 on its contract.

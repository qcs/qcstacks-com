Jay Bruce&rsquo;s recent struggles at the plate may have a simple explanation: the slugger&rsquo;s knee has a partially torn meniscus. As a result of that injury, Bruce will undergo surgery for his left knee and is expected to miss three-to-four weeks. Bruce has a .352 on-base percentage so his absence will be sorely missed. Chris Heisey, Skip Schumaker and Roger Bernadina will take turns filling in for Bruce in right field.

The City of Cincinnati is adamant about closing a half-dozen halfway houses that violate city zoning laws. All of the houses are based in Price Hill and hold 12 to 14 people each. New Foundations Transitional Living, the company who manages the houses, has 90 days to have their residents seek other accommodations or bring its facilities up into compliance with the zoning code.

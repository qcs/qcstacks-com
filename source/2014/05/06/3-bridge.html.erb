A new Ohio bill will be heading to voters on the heels of the Kentucky Legislature&rsquo;s failure to pass legislation allowing the $2.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge project to begin this year. The bill would allow drivers to pay tolls without having to stop on the bridge by using a remote transponder that tracks how many times regular commuters cross the bridge or by snapping license plate photos of drivers. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the bill would prevent any tolling company to keep the license plate photos past a certain amount of time.

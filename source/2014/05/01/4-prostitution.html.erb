This year, Cincinnati is cracking down on prostitution and human trafficking and there were several visible signs of that effort this week. First there was a notice from Law Enforcement that they would be erecting temporary barricades on McMicken, an urban corridor notorious for solicitation. Secondly, two members of City Council have announced an effort to publicize the names of any convicted johns so as to deter their behavior via public shaming.

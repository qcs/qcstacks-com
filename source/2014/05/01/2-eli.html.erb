Those dismayed by Eli&rsquo;s BBQ&rsquo;s long lines at its Eastern Avenue location have a reason to rejoice as the popular restaurant will soon be opening a second location at Findlay Market. Eli&rsquo;s started at the market years ago and will open at one of the three renovated store fronts along the south side of the market. Eli&rsquo;s new location will be open until 9 p.m. six days a week. A craft chocolate maker, Maverick Chocolate, also announced plans to open in one of the renovated store fronts.

Ok bourbon fans, you'll be happy to know that the region's biggest liquor store Party Source has officially joined the ranks of the Bourbon Trail. And not because of their enormous retail selection, either. New Riff Distillery, which is set open to the public next week is the latest addition to the sprawling boozy-compound in Bellevue, KY. They plan to offer tours, events and other functions while their production line of bourbon and other spirits gets cooking.

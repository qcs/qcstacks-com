Depsite all the fuss it looks like there&rsquo;s going to be a bike lane on Central Parkway after all. City Council voted Wednesday 5-4 in favor of bike lanes connecting Downtown, Over-the-Rhine, West End, University Heights, Clifton and Northside. The majority of the project's $500,000 price tag will come from funds provided by the Federal Government. Concerns regarding lack of parking spaces for businesses along Central Parkway have been addressed with a modified plan that will save 23 parking space near the Mohawk Building.

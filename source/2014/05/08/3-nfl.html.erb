The Cincinnati Bengals are slated to pick No. 24 in the first round of this year&rsquo;s NFL Draft happening tonight at Radio City Music Hall in New York. According to head coach Marvin Lewis, the team is looking for any position other than a quarterback. The Cincinnati Enquirer reports the team is leaning toward a cornerback &mdash; possibly Justin Gilbert of Oklahoma State or Darqueze Dennard of Michigan State &mdash; or a linebacker.

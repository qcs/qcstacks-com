  Middletown residents are waiting on bated breath today for results of levy recount that will determine whether or not the Butler County school system will receive $40 million in state grants. The vote originally passed by just 18 votes with 2,924 in support and 2,906 opposing the 4-mill bond issue and 0.26-mill permanent improvement levy. The recount should be completed by the end of this month.

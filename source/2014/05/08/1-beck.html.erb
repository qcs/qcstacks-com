Representative Peter Beck, who faces 69 felony counts, is adamant to finish his term as state representative despite being rebuked by 91 percent of his fellow Republicans. The felony counts stem from allegations of defrauding investors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Beck lost the primary race to Mason real estate developer Paul Zeltwanger. Despite numerous requests from his own party to resign, Beck says he will finish his term that ends in January.

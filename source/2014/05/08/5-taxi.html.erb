Ridesharing services Lyft and Uber are already causing a stir among Cincinnati&rsquo;s taxi drivers. About 20 taxi drivers, owners and supporters gathered outside of City Hall Wednesday to convince City Council to impose similar regulations on Lyft and Uber as are imposed on the taxi companies. Those regulations include mandatory vehicle inspections, liability insurance and fare meters in vehicles.

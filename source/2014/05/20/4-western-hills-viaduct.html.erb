City officials and planners are floating the idea of leveraging the Western Hills viaduct for new transit options into downtown. The crumbling bridge, which has been named one of the worst in the country, has been estimated to need at least $240MM in repairsâ€“ a huge sum for any cash-strapped city and some see the additional transit corridor as a way to sweeten the deal. Michael Moore, Cincinnati's director of transportation and engineering will present the idea to council's transportation committee next week.

The city&rsquo;s proposed budget will not include capital funding that was promised to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Authority that was intended for neighborhood redevelopment efforts. Mayor John Cranley said he personally had no involvement in the decision and that it was Interim City Manager Scott Stile&rsquo;s decision not to include the $6 million. The mayor did propose the Port Authority receive $1 million in annual revenue during the next 30 years by leasing the Fountain Square South Garage to the port.

Nearly $11 million in pharmaceuticals were seized by the Food and Drug Administration from a Cincinnati company because the drugs were either unapproved or misbranded. The bust took place from Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is based in Norwood. The drugs included ear infection drops, hemorrhoid and other inflammatory condition pills, and a skin-rash cream.

A state grant will go a long way toward rehabbing the historic Eden Park pump station into a modern-day brewery. The Ohio Controlling Board approved a Clean Ohio Assistance Fund totaling $736,520 to be used to redevelop the location. The brewery will feature an outside beer garden and a tap room. Retired city architect Jack Martin is a leading investor. Plans are to have the brewery up and running by spring of next year.

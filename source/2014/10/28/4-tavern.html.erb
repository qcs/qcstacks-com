Kreuger’s Tavern will take the place of Lavomatic on Vine Street in Over-the-Rhine in December. The new restaurant and bar is owned by the Thunderdome Restaurant Group, which also owns Bakersfield and The Eagle. Kreuger’s will feature sausages made in-house, sloppy Joe’s and an assortment of tavern food. The restaurant will also offer a large selection of canned beer and is named after the first brewery to sell beer in cans.

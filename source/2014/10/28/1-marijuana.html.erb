A City Council Committee voted Monday 5-0 for marijuana offenders to expunge those offenses off of their permanent records. The impetus for the decision came from a 2006 city ordinance that criminalized even a small amount of the drug. The  ordinance classified the offense as a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by 30 days in jail and a $250 fine, according to City Beat.

The 1,500-student School for the Creative and Performing Arts is having a rough year. The latest chapter found troubled school in need of a takeover from the Cincinnati Public School District after SCPAâ€™s fundraising was hit by a Ponzi scheme run by Glen Galemmo. The Ponzi scheme almost forced the school to cancel its fall performance schedule, but an anonymous donation of $265,000 prevented that from happening.

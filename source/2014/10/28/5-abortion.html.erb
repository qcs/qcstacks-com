Due to a controversial 2013 law, the region’s last abortion clinic could soon be closed. The law requires abortion clinics to form agreements with private hospitals to transfer patients in case of an emergency. If Planned Parenthood's Elizabeth Campbell Surgical Center doesn’t show proof of a partnership with a hospital it will bring Ohio’s total abortion clinic count down to 8 from 14 when the Republican-sponsored law went into effect.

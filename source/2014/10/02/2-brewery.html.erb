Despite Cincinnati having somewhat of a brewing renaissance, our neighbors in the bluegrass are not seeing as many former breweries raising from their graves. In what looks to be another blow to Kentucky’s brewing heritage, the owners of the old Bavarian Brewery submitted a zoning application to tear the building down. The building recently housed the restaurant Jillian’s and has been vacant since 2006.

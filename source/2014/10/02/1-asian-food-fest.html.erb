Ok foodies… this coming Sunday marks the fifth installment of Asian Food Fest. The event this year, who’s mission is to bring Asian culture and culinary traditions to the tri-state, will be held in Washington Park. From Vietnam to the Philippines and everywhere in-between, the festival provides a tasty tour of the far-east palette via small plates, priced between $2 and $6.

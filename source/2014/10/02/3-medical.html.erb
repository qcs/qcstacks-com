If Ohio doesn’t pony up and comply with federal law covering Medicaid eligibility for three Hamilton County couples, billions of dollars and health care coverage for more than 2 million Ohioans could be lost. Ohio has until Oct. 6 to show proof of compliance regarding the three couples. If the state fails to show coverage, the U.S. District Court of Southern Ohio would issue an order demanding the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services withhold federal funding of Ohio’s Medicaid program.

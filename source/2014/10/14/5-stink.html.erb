Without any natural enemies and an abundant source of food, expect to see even more stink bugs around your home next year. Fortunately the the bugs donâ€™t bite, but do release a musk that has been likened to pungent cilantro when squashed. Their spray can also permanently stink-up furniture. The USDA estimated the bugs caused more than $35 million in damages to U.S. apple orchards in 2010. The Asian stink bugs most likely came our way aboard a container ship close to 10 years ago.

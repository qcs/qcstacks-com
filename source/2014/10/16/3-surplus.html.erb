Due to $5.9 million in increased revenues for the City of Cincinnati and a $7.8 million savings from belt tightening, the city has an estimated $18 million surplus as of June 30. City Manager Harry Black has released a number of recommendations for where he would like to see the city spend the extra money: $4.25 million in emergency weather events; $4 million to repay neighborhoods so they can improve projects such as community centers and parks; $3.3 million in a police and fire department contingency fund. Black’s wish list totals just above $13 million and he said he would put the remainder into the city’s rainy day fund.

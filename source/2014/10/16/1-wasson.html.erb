The city department charged with creating a plan for Wasson Way has officially unveiled the results of its study. In a nutshell, it recommends that the corridor be used for rail transit and/or bicycle and pedestrian use. With this report in hand, the city can now go back to the Planning Commission and formalize the effort to acquire the land from Norfolk Southern.

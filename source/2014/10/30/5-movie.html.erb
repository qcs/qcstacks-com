The movie producers behind the Cincinnati-filmed Carol enjoyed their experience with the Queen City so much they decided to come back to film a new movie starring Jessica Biel and Patrick Wilson. The movie, The Blunderer, is based on a book by the same author as Carol and is a psychological thriller set in the 1950s.

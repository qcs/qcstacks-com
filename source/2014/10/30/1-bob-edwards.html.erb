New video has surfaced that shows Bob Edwards, the founder of the Rubber Duck Regatta, walking into oncoming traffic a couple weeks ago. This is terrifyingâ€“ according to the report, he must have been suffering some sort of mental lapse as stepped into traffic not once, but twice before we he was struck by a passing cement truck.

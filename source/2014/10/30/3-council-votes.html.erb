Cincinnati City Council took care of business this week. On Wednesday– they voted on what to do with an $18MM surplus, Mayor Cranley’s Hand Up anti-poverty program, gave cops a 1.5% raise and extended the FOP contract, regulated ride-sharing ventures like Uber and Lyft and made it easier to get misdemeanor pot charges expunged.

Despite being pushed out of the Novemberâ€™s ballot for the Icon Tax, Music Hall is continuing to seek funds elsewhere to fund its rehabilitation plans. Music Hall is trying to capture $25 million from the Ohio Historic Tax Credit Program and is in competition with three other buildings in both Cleveland and Akron. The $25 million would help bridge the gap needed to raise the $123 million needed for the renovations.

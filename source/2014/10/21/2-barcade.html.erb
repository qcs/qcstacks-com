In the first quarter of 2015, a new bar experience will be coming to Mercer Commons in OTR in the form a 16-bit arcade. The concept has already proven extremely popular with thriving locations in both Columbus and Cleveland. Patrons can expect adult beverages steeped in 80â€™s nostalgia. While you sip your cocktail, you can enjoy one of many old-timey arcade games, sure to whisk you back to your childhood.

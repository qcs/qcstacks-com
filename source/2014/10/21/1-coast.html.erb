In its latest transportation fight COAST is trying to stop the use of tolls to pay for the $2.6 billion Brent Spence bridge. The use of tolls was proposed to fast-track the development of the bridge, which has been stalled in the planning phases for 13 years. The 51-year-old bridge is part of the nationâ€™s busiest freight corridor on I75.

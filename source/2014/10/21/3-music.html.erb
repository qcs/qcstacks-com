Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Alison Grimes as voting day approaches. A new poll shows McConnell slightly ahead of Grimes by 44-43 among likely voters. The 72-year-old McConnell was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and is currently the most powerful Republican in the senate as the Senate Minority Leader.

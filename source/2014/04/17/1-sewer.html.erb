Hamilton County Commissioners are asking a federal judge to intervene in their dispute with the city of Cincinnati regarding hiring and procurement policies for the Metropolitan Sewer District. County Commissioners claim the policies implemented by the city are both illegal and unfair, according to WVXU. The county-owned, city-operated MSD is poised to award more than $3 billion for construction projects within the next decade.

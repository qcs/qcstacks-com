In response to recent concerns voiced by business leaders and a couple of council members, Mayor John Cranley has directed the Interim City Manager Scott Stiles to not award a contract for the Central Parkway Bike Trail project, which would install bike lines on either side of the thoroughfare at the expense of already limited parking during rush hour. This move has project enthusiasts furious, including fellow Councilman Chris Seelbach who claims the decision isn't his to make under the City Charter. Seelbach further contends that this an example of executive action by the mayor in lieu of council direction, the very thing he's been worried about.

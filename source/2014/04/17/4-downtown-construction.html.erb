Live or work downtown? Then you're probably one of many who have been recently stymied by road or construction work and the resulting traffic on basically every block from the Banks to Clifton. Luckily, the city is aware and is working to help educate commuters on what's and where everything is taking place. Next week, they're launching a new website, roadmapcincy.com, which should shed some light on how to circumnavigate the congestion... just don't check it while you're driving.

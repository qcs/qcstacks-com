The Banks have a new ally in the Cincinnati Bengals as part of their pitch to attract the new General Electric building and 2,000 jobs that come with it to downtown. If Hamilton County and the Cincinnati Bengals agree on a deal that promises the Bengals  significant upgrades to Paul Brown Stadium if height restrictions are waived for buildings at The Banks. Waiving the height restrictions for the planned GE building might tip the scales in favor for The Banks against Mason and Oakley who are also trying to attract GE to build in their communities.

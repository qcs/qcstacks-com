Following his controversial ruling on Monday that stated gay couples, married in other states should be recognized under Ohio state law, Federal Judge Timothy Black has allowed the current ban to remain in place, pending appeal of the case. While his overall position on the matter remains aligned with all other federal cases and recent decisions nationwide, litigation of the controversial laws are destined for the Supreme Court. As a result, the final say in this lengthy battle is a long way off... in the meantime, keep on discriminating Ohio.

Eric Deters a high-profile and often outspoken regional attorney, has decided to resign from the Kentucky Bar and quit practicing in the commonwealth, a decision that stems from the Bar's, quote, "mission to 'get' me." Deters claims to have tirelessly fought (and won) over 50 complaints against him; complaints that he maintains were baseless and without meritâ€“ save four, in which he was found guilty of making misstatements to the court. The resulting suspensions encouraged similar reciprocal suspensions in Ohio, thus preventing him from practicing law in either state for some time.

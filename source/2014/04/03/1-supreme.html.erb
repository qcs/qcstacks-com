The class-action lawsuit filed by Fifth Third employees in 2008 regarding massive cuts in employee&rsquo;s retirement accounts was held this week in the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the employees claim Fifth Third executives knew their stock had become risky, but continued to invest in the company stock plan that funds the employees' retirement accounts. Fifth Third stock dropped 75 percent from July 2007 to September 2009, which cost employees tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether or not employees can sue their companies over retirement plan losses.

For all the hoopla that Mayor John Cranley generated while trying to kill the streetcar in the name of saving the city money, all he did was end up making the project more expensive. The three-week pause in construction cost the city almost $1 million, which includes more than $637,000 in downtime for contractors. The December delay will add approximately 20 days to the project completion date of April 4, 2016. Passengers are still expected to be able to ride the streetcar in September 2016.

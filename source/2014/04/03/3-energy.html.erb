In 2008 Ohio established clean energy standards that required utilities to receive a certain amount of their electricity from renewable sources. The amount of energy from renewable sources was to increase year after year. Republicans didn&rsquo;t think this was a good idea and a bill sponsored by Green Township Sen. Bill Seitz is on its way to freeze the standards at current levels, which would cancel any further increases in renewable power usage.

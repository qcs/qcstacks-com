Cincinnati is on the short-list to host the 2016 GOP Convention after making the first round of cuts. Cincinnati will have to compete against Cleveland, Las Vegas, Dallas, Denver and Kansas City for the honors of welcoming thousands of old white males to celebrate other old white males. If Cincinnati were chosen to host the convention, festivities would most likely take place at U.S. Bank Arena. The final decision should be made by the end of the summer.

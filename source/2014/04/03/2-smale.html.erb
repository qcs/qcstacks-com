Smale Riverfront Park continues to rake in the cash. The park just secured a combined total of $12.5 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the City of Cincinnati for improvements and upgrades to the park. The Engineers gave the money to the park to pay for erosion and flooding control along the Ohio River and the city&rsquo;s money will go toward other improvements such as Heekin/PNC Grow Up Great Adventure Playground. The park still needs an additional $5 million to be completed by 2017.

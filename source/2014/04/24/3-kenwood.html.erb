Good news for Kenwood residents and traveling southbound commuters, Messer Construction Co. is on the job at Kenwood Towne Place. Finally, after more than 5 years, the rusting monstrosity that has sat idle within an glance of the one of regionâ€™s busiest thoroughfares, has a plan and a projected date of completion. The new office tower will now be known as Kenwood Collection and should be ready to accept new tenants as early as 2015.

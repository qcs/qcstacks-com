If there&rsquo;s one thing you can say about Mayor John Cranley it&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s not shy of speaking his mind. In an extended interview with the website Urbanophile, Cranley talks about the city&rsquo;s history, gay rights, the streetcar and compares Cincinnati to the San Francisco of the Midwest. The entire interview is transcribed on the site, but do yourself a favor and listen to the audio.

Cincinnati is all abuzz this week about the latest bike-lane dust-up. At issue is a plan from the former city administration to install a protected bike lane on either side of Central Parkway. Following some concerns voiced by business leaders and members of city council, Mayor Cranley decided to re-debate the issue until all misgivings were officially put to bed (again). In short, this delay has not only yielded a new compromise that will cost the city an additional $100,000 but also widened the gap between opposing council factions. If council fails to accept the compromise, the project may be dead entirely.

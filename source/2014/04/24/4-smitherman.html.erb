A couple weeks ago, in the wake of a report stating that there had been 22 homicides in the first quarter of 2014, Councilman Chris Smitherman made some controversial statements about violent crime within the black community. Those statements have erupted into calls for his replacement as chairman of the Law and Public Safety Committee. Last night, Mayor Cranley rejected those appeals and stood behind Smitherman and the work he's done in that position.

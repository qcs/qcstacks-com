Bike lanes on Central Parkway be damned, the city’s first bike sharing program is expected to launch this summer. Mayor John Cranley and the program’s director said the program will start with 35 stations and 300 bikes in downtown, Over-the-Rhine and near the University of Cincinnati. Cranley agreed to give Cincy Bike Share $1.1 million in startup funds to get the program off the ground.

Northside hipsters were enraged Saturday morning when Shepard Faireyâ€™s mural depicting Aung San Suu Kyi was mistakingly painted over. Victor Williams, who owns the building at the intersection of Hamilton Avenue and Blue Rock Street, said Fairey has plans to return to Cincinnati and create something new in its place instead of trying to refinish the mural.

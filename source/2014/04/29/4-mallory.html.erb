State Representative Dale Mallory for Ohio's 32nd House District has a problem with getting to work. Specifically, the Enquirer reports that he has missed almost 15% of house sessions since 2011 and is listed among the top 5 worst attendance records in the state. According to Mallory, he missed at least 2 of those sessions due to dealing with sickness in his family. He attributes the rest of the problem to obligations elsewhere and spending time amongst his constituents in Cincinnati.

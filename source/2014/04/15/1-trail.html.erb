A 2.2-mile segment of The Ohio River trail will go a long way toward completing the trail project that will ultimately stretch 23 miles from Coney Island to Sayler Park. The new segment runs from Salem Road to Sutton Road along California&rsquo;s riverfront. The section of the trail should be completed by June 2017 and will feature a 12-foot wide asphalt path that will be mixed use for pedestrians and bicyclists.

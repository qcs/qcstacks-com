Following the recent tide of similar judgments around the nation, federal judge Timothy Black has ruled that Ohio's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The highly controversial decision is simply another battle in the long-running war that will most certainly end up on the Supreme Court docket; in fact, Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine is already planning his appeal. Opponents of gay marriage are now hoping the court will issue a stay on the ruling, pending appeal.

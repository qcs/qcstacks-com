What was once home to a department store, a presidential re-election campaign headquarters and a host to a number of small businesses, The Hanke Building will reopen its doors soon to an international technology company when Neo moves into the architectural gem. The Over-the-Rhine building was constructed in 1876 and saved in 1995 3-days before demolition by a group dedicated to architectural preservation. It has been recently renovated and is featured on the National Register of Historic Places.

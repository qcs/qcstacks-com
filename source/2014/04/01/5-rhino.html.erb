Sad news from the Zoo this weekend. One of three extremely rare Sumatran rhinos born in 2004 has died due to a (possibly hereditary) iron-storage disease. Given the species status on the endangered list, the loss is being taken particularly hard. According to WVXU, there are approximately 100 Sumatran rhinos left so the Cincinnati Zoo has been working tirelessly to develop techniques for breeding them in captivity.

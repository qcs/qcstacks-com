Ride sharing has officially descended upon Cincinnati, and now residents can count on Lyft to provide a transportation alternative to the recently launched Uber service. Like Uber users download an app, plugin in their coordinates and method of payment and a driver will pick you up and ferry you across town for a nominal fee (which is apparently less than a typical cab fare). Lyft says that drivers are rigorously screened and interviewed in-person, so you won't be comprising on safety either.

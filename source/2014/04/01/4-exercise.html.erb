The Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Interact for Health, wants you to get out and get active and they're awarding close to half a million dollars to spread the word. In a series of separate, very generous grants of up to $50,000, the organization is helping local communities install and expand their access for parks, hiking trails, community pools and more in effort to promote a healthy lifestyle for citizens across the city.

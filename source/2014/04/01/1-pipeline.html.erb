CityBeat reports that the broken pipeline in Colerain, which had resulted in an oil spill in the middle of Glen Oak Nature Preserve, has been repaired and is back in operation. More than 20,000 gallons of oil were spilled as a result of the accident and crews will continue cleanup efforts for about another week. The organization responsible for maintenance and repairs plans to replace that section of the pipeline entirely in the near future.

Red's Opening Day was yesterday and the parade was a huge success, the game– not so much. The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals for the first game of the season and just couldn't get anything going– in fact, this was the first Opening Day shut-out in more than 60 years! Players and staff were optimistic though. This is the first game of the season so there's lot of opportunity to improve.

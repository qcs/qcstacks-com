We hope no one ever accused Butler County Commissioner Cindy Carpenter of having low self-esteem. The incumbent commissioner recently posted a billboard in Fairfield congratulating herself and her campaign as commissioner despite her primary election being four weeks away. Carpenter insists the billboard wasn&rsquo;t a mistake and is part of a larger message she has planned for her campaign. Ohio Election Commission officials are unsure if the billboard is an election violation and will follow-up with an investigation if a complaint is made.

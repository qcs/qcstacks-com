Former Athletic Director for NKU, Scott Eaton has plead guilty to theft in excess of $300,000 and will spend the next decade in prison. According to the plea deal he copped last week, Eaton has admitted to using his university issued credit-card for buying personal items such as groceries and had even accepted thousands of dollars in inappropriate reimbursements from the school. His formal sentencing next month will close a case that first gained regional attention when Eaton was fired in March 2013.

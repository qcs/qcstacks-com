The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&rsquo; and business owners&rsquo; concerns.

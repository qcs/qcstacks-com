Slowly but surely Cincinnati&rsquo;s economy is showing signs of being on the up-and-up. Recent news from a report by a local real estate firm shows the local industrial vacancy rate fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The vacancy rate hasn&rsquo;t dropped below 6 percent in seven years, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. A lower vacancy rate means companies are hiring developers to construct new buildings.

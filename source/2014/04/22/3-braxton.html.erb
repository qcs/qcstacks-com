Another day in Cincinnati, another up-start brewery in the works. This one is coming to 7th and Pike Street in Covington and is the product of Richard Dub√©, former VP of Brewing at Christian Moerlein. He and some fellow craft beer enthusiasts are placing an emphasis on education in hopes to cultivate a higher level of appreciate amongst their consumers. Look for Braxton Brewing's adult beverages to make their debut by the end of the year.

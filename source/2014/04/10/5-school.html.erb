$59 million in state funding is at stake when Fairfield and Middletown voters go to the polls May 6 to vote to decide if the districts should upgrade their aging school buildings. If voters reject the tax increase as they did in November, the state funding will be pulled and appropriated to another school district. If the Fairfield levy were approved, annual taxes on a $100,000 home would increase by $91. The Middletown levy, if passed, would increase annual property taxes by $149 for a $100,000 home.

JobsOhio has announced that multinational conglomerate GE has plans to build one of five global shared services centers in Cincinnati. The decision is expected to bring 1400 jobs to the region and is an effort by the company to standardize shared functions between its operations such as finance and IT. While they're still deciding whether to locate the new facility in Oakley or downtown at the Banks, the project should be completed by 2017.

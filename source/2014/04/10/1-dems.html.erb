Cincinnati Democratic leaders including Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld are pointing their fingers at Gov. John Kasich and his across-the-board income tax cuts as a cause for the city&rsquo;s decline in public services. Cincinnati has received 50 percent decrease in local government funding during the last two years. In addition to the $12 million cut form the local government fund, Gov. Kasich also repealed the estate tax that played a large part in funding local government. A report from Policy Matters, a non-profit policy research organization, found that state aid to local communities has decreased $1.1 billion since the 2011-12 fiscal year.

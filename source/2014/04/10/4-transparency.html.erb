Ohio received a &ldquo;D-&rdquo; in its efforts to provide an open and transparent government to its citizens, according to national consumer group designed to protect American citizens from powerful interest groups. The ranking puts Ohio in the bottom five in the nation at providing its citizenry with accessible information such as &ldquo;customizable search options including bid award recipients, keywords, agency and bulk download searches,&rdquo; according to City Beat. Despite Ohio&rsquo;s poor ranking, Cincinnati fares quite well in its efforts to be transparent and received a &ldquo;B+&rdquo; in a study that examined the nation&rsquo;s 30 largest cities.

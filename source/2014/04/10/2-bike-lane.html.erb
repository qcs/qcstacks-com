Now that the streetcar debate has been settled and it moving forward regardless of the naysayer arguments, business leaders investing in city's urban core now have a new gripe with city planners. This time, it involves the city's plan to install a cycle track along Central Parkway and the associated parking restrictions that come with it. Under the proposal, parking would be restricted along the route during rush hour on adjacent sides of the street based on the time of day. Opponents of the plan think alternate solutions should be considered as restricting parking could hurt business.

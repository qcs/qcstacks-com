Scott Stiles&rsquo; tenure as interim city manager may be finished soon. Mayor John Cranley hopes to complete his search for a permanent city manager by July 1 and has hired an outside search committee at a $38,750 to do so. Cranely said the permanent city manager must have a strong personality and that Stiles is in contention for the gig.

Smale Riverfront Park is getting infused with millions of dollars in additional cash to help complete many of the ongoing projects there in preparation for the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In addition to the existing fountains, swings and picturesque river walk, park officials are working on more water features, expanding the river walk to the west of the Roebling bridge, multiple esplanades and playgrounds for the kiddos. Maybe its time for Northern Kentucky to consider upping it's game.

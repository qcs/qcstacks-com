It's been a wild ride for the controversial Brent Spence Bridge replacement project. First, Kentucky lawmakers banned the use of tolls on interstate highways running through Kentucky and then voted to strip millions of dollars previously allocated for the construction effort. Both actions served to irk area business leaders but thankfully, the committee has decided to reverse course on the initial funding provision. While the senate will still have to pass the bill for it to become a reality, the reversal has many enthusiasts resting a little easier today.

Plans are in works to help move Paragon Salons, the tenant who is holding up a $97 million downtown development deal, from Pogue&rsquo;s garage. The developer behind the proposed 30-story, 300-luxury apartment building agreed to step-in and cover some of the salon&rsquo;s relocation and rebuilding costs. Paragon&rsquo;s lease expires in the garage in 2017 and the salon currently employs 36 people and serves close to 500 customers per week. The salon recently filed a lawsuit in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas against the city to allow it to stay in its current location until their lease expires.

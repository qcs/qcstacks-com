It will take 18 months to complete the federally mandated work on the city's sewer system and unless they get started soon, the city and county could be facing fines of up to $1,000 a day. MSD, the organization responsible for completing the work, wants the ordinance suspended but the council has not yet been able to secure the votes necessary to do so.

Opponents of gambling and the introduction of new casino's always argue about the implications of crime on the surrounding community, but according to a new report by WVXU, that hasn't been a problem for Horseshoe Casino in it's first year of operation. The Cincinnati Police Commander for the Business Sector says that while the general perception of safety downtown isn't great, that's not a realistic view.

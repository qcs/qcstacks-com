Cincinnati residents and businesses will soon be able to choose what type of energy they want to receive from the city. The city has been buying 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources such as wind or solar since 2012, but Interim City Manager Scott Stiles recently struck a two-year deal with First Energy Solutions that gave residents the choice of fossil-fuels, which would save them $5.63 per year. Residents now have the choice to select the cheaper option of fossil-fuels if they want to save a few bucks but they run the risk of pissing off Mother Nature.

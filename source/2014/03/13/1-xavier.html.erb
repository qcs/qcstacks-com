Local 12 reports that a former Xavier basketball player is suing the school thanks to an allegation of rape. Dez Wells claims that when the University expelled him as a result of the charge, his reputation was damaged. Following the decision by a grand jury to not take up the case, the charge was dropped, though Wells' expulsion was not reversed.

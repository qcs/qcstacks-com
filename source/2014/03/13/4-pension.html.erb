  Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley unveiled his solution to fix the city’s $870 million pension problem. Cranley’s fixes include a one-time injection of $100 million into the system and negotiations with retiree’s that stipulate their cost-of-living increases would not exceed three percent simple interest. Stakes are high for figuring out a solution to the plan because the city only has 60 cents for every $1 it owes retirees.

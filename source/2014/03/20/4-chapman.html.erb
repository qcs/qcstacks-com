Cincinnati Red&rsquo;s pitcher Aroldis Chapman took a line drive to the face off the bat of Kansas City Royals&rsquo; catcher Salvador Perez that landed the Reds&rsquo; high-speed southpaw in the hospital with a fracture above his left eye. Chapman never lost consciousness and was able to communicate and move his hands, feet and legs. Reds manager Bryan Price is expected to make an announcement on Chapman&rsquo;s recovery later today.

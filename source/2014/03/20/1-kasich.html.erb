Lt. Governor-candidate Sharon Neuhardt took issue with current-Governor John Kasich&rsquo;s tax-cut proposal saying it further promotes the governor&rsquo;s agenda of helping Ohio&rsquo;s top 1 percent. Neuhardt said Kasich&rsquo;s reasoning that cutting the income tax by 8.5 percent would benefit single mothers is &ldquo;despicable and wrong.&rdquo; CityBeat reports that Kasich&rsquo;s previous budget started pushing the state&rsquo;s top tax rate below 5 percent and raising the sales tax, tactics that disproportionately favor the wealthiest citizens. Neuhardt said if the governor was interested in helping single mothers he should do so with meaningful reforms, not tax cuts.

Ohio Governor John Kasich is recommending $10 million in funding from the Ohio General Assembly for two historic buildings in Cincinnati. While the sum, split between Union Terminal and Music Hall, is only a fraction of what is needed to repair and renovate the two buildings, the show of commitment from state officials is welcomed by local leaders.

Yesterday, City Council approved a plan designed to settle the city's looming pension debacle, once and for all. The path forward, advanced by Mayor John Cranley requires the city to negotiate the terms of the settlement in federal court, hopefully including all city employees as part of a mandatory class action lawsuit. The terms of the negotiation will include a cap on cost of living increases and the reduction of health benefits for retirees.

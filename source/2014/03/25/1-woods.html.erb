Mayor John Cranley has his sights on turning Burnet Woods into something like New York City&rsquo;s Central Park. Cranley&rsquo;s impetus on rehabbing Burnet Woods is to provide residents of Clifton and Corryville a top-notch public park similar to the renovated Washington Park. Cranley said Burnet Woods&rsquo; current state is &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an enormous asset that&rsquo;s underutilized.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s plan includes linking the park to the University of Cincinnati campus by use of a pedestrian bridge over Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Despite being on Cranley&rsquo;s wish list, the project wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day until at least 2016.

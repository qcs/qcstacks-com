With opening day just under a week away, Reds fans start 2014 with a bit of anxiety as their team has been plagued with a plethora of off-season injuries. In addition to the injured players the Reds are knee-deep in expensive multiyear deals with Homer Bailey, Brandon Phillips, Jay Bruce and Joey Votto. Four of the Reds pitchers&rsquo; contracts also expire in the next year or two, which means unless big things happen soon the the small-market Reds might face a few years of rebuilding. The Reds open the season at Great American Ballpark next Monday at 4:10 p.m. vs. the Saint Louis Cardinals.

Despite cutting nearly 50 percent of money distributed to the Local Government Fund and eliminating the estate tax - of which 80 percent went to cities and townships - Gov. John Kasich doesn&rsquo;t believe the lack of funding for local governments is his doing. Kasich sat down with an interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer where he scoffed at local governments&rsquo; claims that his cuts would hamper their budgets: "With a 3 to 5 (percent) devastating cut in their Local Government Fund, how could they survive that?" he scoffed. "Seriously. I mean, 3 to 5 (percent) &mdash; wow."

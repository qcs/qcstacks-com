Orchestral enthusiasts and Langree fan-folk can now officially rest easy, Lumenocity is returning to Washington Park in early August, 2014. The original ceremony to introduce the new conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra to thousands of excited fans was a resounding success last year, bringing more than 35,000 people into the park over two days. Featuring a projection mapped graphic display set against adjacent, historic Music Hall, the event was the talk of town for months. Be sure to put this on your calendars folks, you don't want to miss it.

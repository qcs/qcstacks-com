You remember that weird old-timey building with the big spire thingie, just south of Krohn's conservatory in Eden Park? That's Pump Station No. 7 and if you haven't heard, its being converted into Cincinnati's latest beer production facility, Brewery X. They plan to offer a wide array of frothy adult beverages in their tap room and hope to be open by next spring. Cheers to more beers!

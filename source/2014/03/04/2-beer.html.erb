After helping setup Christian Moerlein&rsquo;s brewing and lager house, head brewer Richard Dub&eacute; is leaving the company effective immediately.  Dub&eacute;&rsquo;s recipes are the base for every beer produced by Christian Moerlein after it started brewing all of its own beers. Dub&eacute; was recently promoted to Vice President of Brewing Operations after helping launch Moerlein&rsquo;s OTR production facility. Modern-day beer baron and Moerlien CEO Greg Hardman said he wishes Richard &ldquo;the best of luck as he pursues other endeavors.&rdquo;

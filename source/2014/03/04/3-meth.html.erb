Ohio Police have found 315 methamphetamine labs since October 2013, a pace that is set to break the record set in 2009 when 348 were found. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said meth abuse has hit epidemic proportions in the state, most notably in rural areas. Southwest Ohio counties Highland, Clermont and Fairfield are all reporting a jump in meth lab seizures.

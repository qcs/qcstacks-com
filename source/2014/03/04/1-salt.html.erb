In the wake of yet another winter storm, the Cincinnati Department of Public Services said it was almost $4.7 million over budget this winter. Close to $1 million was spent on overtime for snow plow drivers and maintenance workers while another $2.8 million was spent for extra salt supplies. The county has gone through about 22,000 tons of salt so far this winter.

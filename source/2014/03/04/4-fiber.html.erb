Councilman Sittenfeld and other tech startup executives are working to bring Google Fiber to Cincinnati. The service, which is reportedly up to 100 times faster than normal broadband service, is up for grabs thanks to a national contest which will declare the next hi-speed, municipal benefactor. The winning city will be announced by the end of 2014.

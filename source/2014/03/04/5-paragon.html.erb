Following lots of momentum from city council and former Mayor Mark Mallory, the deal to construct a new high-rise apartment complex on the corner of Fourth and Race streets appears to be stalled, if not dead completely. Mayor John Cranley has opposed any further relocation negotiations with Paragon Salons, the remaining tenant who's lease runs through 2017. If the deal does fall through, that will leave the city on the hook for maintenance repairs to Pogue's garage, which will reportedly come in higher than the cost to relocate Paragon.

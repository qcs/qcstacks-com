After being denied a spot in 2013&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade, a local gay education group wasn&rsquo;t allowed to apply for this year&rsquo;s parade. The Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network&rsquo;s co-chair said the application form to participate wasn&rsquo;t posted on the parade&rsquo;s website and organizers never returned GLSEN&rsquo;s phone calls. The parade starts this Saturday at noon at Eggleston Street south of Gilbert Avenue.

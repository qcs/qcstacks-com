Hot on the heels of City Hall&rsquo;s recent push to persuade Google to bring its high-speed Fiber network to Cincinnati, Cincinnati Bell plans to offer gigabit internet speeds to small businesses in June and residential customers by September. Cincinnati Bell&rsquo;s Fioptics Internet package currently offers speeds at 10 megabits per second compared to the 1,000 megabit speed gigabit internet provides. Cincinnati Bell also hopes to expand Fioptics coverage to 70 percent of the Cincinnati area by 2017.

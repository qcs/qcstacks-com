Trying to hail a cab in Cincinnati can be an effort in futility. Thankfully two ridesharing companies &mdash; Uber and Lyft &mdash; are coming to town soon. The companies have been staples in larger cities for a few years now, but recently have been showing up in other Ohio cities such as Columbus and Cleveland. There&rsquo;s no set date for when the companies will arrive, although both have been posting jobs on their websites for the Cincinnati area.

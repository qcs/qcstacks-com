Authorities discovered a large leak of crude oil last night in Colerain Township, spilling into the Oak Glen Nature Preserve. The discovery comes amid resident reports of petroleum odors in the air for days. The spill is evidently originating from a pipeline that stretches from Texas to Michigan and has been operating in the area for decades. The EPA is working with the owner and operator of the pipeline to contain the spill and get things cleaned up.

Cincinnati City Council&rsquo;s budget committee unanimously approved a plan to let the city manager negotiate a 20- to 30-year agreement with city employees and retirees in U.S. District Court to help solve the city&rsquo;s pension problem. The negotiations would most likely include a temporary stop to cost-of-living increases, reduced health benefits and an annual city contribution to the pension fund. Mayor John Cranley says the plan is necessary to deal with the $870 million unfunded pension.

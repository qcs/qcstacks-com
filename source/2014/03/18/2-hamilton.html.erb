Hamilton County Township fiscal officer Jackie Terwilleger resigned Friday after an investigation discovered $2 million in mismanaged funds, falsified checks and unauthorized payments. Warren County officials question why no precaution was taken after Terwilleger&rsquo;s books were called into question in 2004 after an auditor warning. A public hearing of the township&rsquo;s finances is scheduled for April 5.

Lower Price Hill Community School&rsquo;s Community Matters nonprofit is experimenting with a cooperative approach to revitalize their inner-city neighborhood. The nonprofit places the neighborhood&rsquo;s residents at the center of major decision making by the group. The $8.2 renovation of St. Michael the Archangel Parish buildings into a community center called The Sanctuary is the group&rsquo;s first project.

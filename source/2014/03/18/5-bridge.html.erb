The discussion amongst KY lawmakers about what to do with the aging bridge carrying I75 traffic between Ohio and Kentucky continued this week but yielded little progress. While the only consensus is that something must be done, the means to do so was pushed into further limbo as lawmakers voted to ban the use of tolls. While this may come as good news to daily commuters, no one actually knows where the money will come from. Experts have long agreed that tolls are the only way to raise the more than $2 billion dollars it will take to replace the bridge.

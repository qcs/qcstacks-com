Break out the Lederhosen kids, the annual Zinzinnati Oktoberfest kicks off tomorrow afternoon in the Central Business District. Replete with half a million visitors, steins as big as your head and more cream-puffs than you can shake a weiner dog at, this yearâ€™s celebration is the 38th installment and the forecast is calling for beer.

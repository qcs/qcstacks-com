The recommendations proposed last week from the Haile/U.S. Bank Foundation partnership to shore up operating costs of the forthcoming Cincinnati streetcar include reducing the fare by .75c to $1.

Mayor John Cranley said he likes the idea, but has another idea up his sleeve that he has yet to unveil.

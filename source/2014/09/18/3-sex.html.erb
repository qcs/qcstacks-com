Months after raising barricades along sections of McMicken Avenue in Over-the-Rhine to deter prostitution, City Council passed two new ordinances to help curb the cityâ€™s growing sex trafficking problems. Councilwoman Yvette Simpson sponsored both the ordinances, the first of which increases fines for prostitution in a motor vehicle from $500 to $100 and another $2500 for each subsequent offense. The second ordinance puts the money raised from the fines into an anti-prostitution fund that aims to help reduce the number of offenses throughout the city.

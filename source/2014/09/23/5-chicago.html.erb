Two local high speed rail advocates pitched the Hamilton County commissioners an idea that would offer a daily high-speed train service from Cincinnati to Chicago. Their idea would be to piggy back off Amtrakâ€™s lackluster service between Chicago and the Queen City by upgrading the infrastructure of the rail lines. Amtrak currently offers service between Chicago and Cincinnati only three times per week compared to multiple daily trips from Chicago to St. Louis.

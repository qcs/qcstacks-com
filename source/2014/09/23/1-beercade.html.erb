Ever wish that top score you owned on Ms. Pacman was good for something other than bragging rights? Well now you can get 25 percent off drinks at Top Score Beercade located in the basement below Rusconi Pizza if youâ€™re on the leaderboard. The recently opened arcade has been a dream of Scott Sheridan and features classic arcade games such as X-Men, Tekken 4 and a bunch of others. The beercade is open daily from 6 p.m. until close.

The City of Cincinnati might soon sign a parking agreement with Xerox that will give the city the ability adjust the price of parking on the fly. For example, meters might reflect a higher charge if demand is higher because there is a Reds game downtown. The city estimates it could receive close to $500,000 in additional revenue by installing the new meters.

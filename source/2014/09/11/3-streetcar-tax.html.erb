A spokesman for the Haile/U.S. Bank Foundation is in agreement with recent statements Mayor Cranley has made about the need to formulate a plan to cover the operational costs of the streetcar sooner, rather than later. They recommend implementing a “hyper-local” tax on property owners in Downtown and OTR to cover approximately 70% of the cost. The outstanding costs could be covered by fares and sponsorships.

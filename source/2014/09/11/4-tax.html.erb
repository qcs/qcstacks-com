Despite being left off the icon tax on this Novemberâ€™s ballot, supporters of Music Hall are pushing forward to find funding for the aging historic landmark. The 136-year-old building is raising the needed $123 million from private donors, historic tax credits, money from the city and outside sources. The total amount of private donations will be revealed within the next 90 days. The city could also be asked to chip in more than its current allocated $10 million to help complete the project.

Late last night a boat on the Ohio river, carrying two FBI agents, mistakenly crossed in front of a massive barge causing a tragic collision. Both men were killed almost instantly.  This morning, crews continue to search the water for anyone else who may have been onboard at the time. The identities of the deceased are being withheld pending notification of family.

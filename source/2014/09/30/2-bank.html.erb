There’s a new big bank in town this week as U.S. Bank has recently retaken the lead against Fifth Third as the area’s largest institution based on local deposits. Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank had showed deposits of $31.2 billion at 120 Cincinnati locations compared to $25.3 billion from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third at their 130 locations.

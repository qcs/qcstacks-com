The Cincinnati Enquirer has an in-depth profile on Hamilton County Commissioner and Tea Party darling Chris Monzel that gets to the root of what drives his cost-cutting agenda. Monzel ran in 2010 on a platform of aggressive cost cutting and he hasn’t held back so far. Most recently Monzel led the charge to slash Music Hall from the icon tax ballot that’s set to go before voters this November. The 46-year-old is up for reelection this November.

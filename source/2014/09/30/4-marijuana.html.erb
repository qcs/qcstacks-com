City Council will vote this week on a proposal that could help clear the way toward removing the stigma of a marijuana conviction on a person’s record. The resolution will ask Hamilton County judges to exclude marijuana convictions when considering if a person’s record should be expunged. Cincinnati held an unusually strict law from 2006 - 2010 that classified marijuana convictions as misdemeanors, which was stricter than state law.

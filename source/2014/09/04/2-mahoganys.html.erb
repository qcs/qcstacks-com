The landlord who operates the Banks sent the beleaguered Mahogany’s restaurant an eviction letter after the restaurant closed Aug. 26 - 29. The letter from the landlord cited that this wasn’t the first time Mahogany’s has defaulted on its lease, as it has failed to pay its rent on more than one occasion in the past 12 months. The city of Cincinnati has 10 days to save the restaurant by stepping on its behalf to pay back rent and fees. If the city doesn’t step in the restaurant will be forced the close and vacate its location immediately.

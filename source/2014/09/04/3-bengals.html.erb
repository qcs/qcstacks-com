The Bengals have taken a deal with the NFL to remove a local TV blackout if the team sells 85 percent of their home game tickets. The Bengals have sold out their last 10 home games, but due to slow tickets sales this season the team was forced to reduce the TV blackout option to 85 percent. In exchange for making the deal, the team will have give the visiting team a greater percentage of revenue from ticket sales. The Bengals first home game is Sept. 14 against the Atlanta Falcons.

Prosecutor Joe Deters and Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine want to strengthen punishment for certain drug laws to murder. The impetus for the change comes on the heels of the death of a 21-year-old Delhi woman who died of a heroine overdose. The dealer who sold the woman the heroine is currently being charged with involuntary manslaughter in an overdose death.

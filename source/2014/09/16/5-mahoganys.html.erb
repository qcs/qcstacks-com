Embattled Mahogany’s owner and executive chef Liz Rodgers is threatening to sue the city unless it agrees to forgive her $300,000 loan. At issue is her failure to make timely payments on the loan and keep up with her lease at the Banks. She has stipulated that the development of the Banks didn’t to meet her expectations and she was therefore setup for failure. City officials basically laughed at the idea.

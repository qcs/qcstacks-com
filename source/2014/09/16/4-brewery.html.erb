Close to $3 billion in workers’ wages and $10 billion overall comes from Ohio breweries, according to an industry group. The breweries directly employ or support more than 80,000 jobs across the Buckeye state, making Ohio the sixth-largest brewing employer. But despite the craft beer renaissance, MillersCoors continues to operate the region’s largest brewery in Trenton.

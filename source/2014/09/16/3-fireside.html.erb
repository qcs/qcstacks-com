The oldest fire station in Cincinnati is now home to Walnut Hills&rsquo; newest restaurant, Fireside Pizza. The wood-fired pizzeria is located just blocks from Peebles Corner at 773 E. McMillan Street. The restaurant got its start as a food truck and decided to make the leap into a brick and mortar location after receiving investment from Eliâ€™s Barbecue owners Eli Leisring and Drew Simmons. Fireside is open seven days a week from 11 a.m. - 11 p.m.

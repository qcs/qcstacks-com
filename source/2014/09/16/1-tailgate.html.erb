There were more things than just Atlanta Falcons fans&rsquo; hopes falling near Paul Brown Stadium Sunday. Large pieces of concrete and other debris were raining from the underside of the Brent Spence bridge near a parking lot where Bengals fans were tailgating. Thankfully no one was injured, but a 2008 Ford Fusion was heavily damaged thanks to several large pieces of concrete.

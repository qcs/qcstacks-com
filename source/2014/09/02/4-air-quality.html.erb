Take a deep breath, Cincinnati. Thanks mostly to fantastic summer weather, the tri-state has just completed the second summer in a row without a smog alert. Joyous officials who normally mark the start and end of the summer season with regional notifications about carpooling and the dispensing of gasoline, are happy to report the positive trend. Wether it will continue is unknown, but some forthcoming regulations can only help the effort.

If you’ve ever walked along Cincinnati’s Riverfront, you may have come across a curious sculpture situated just below the Purple People bridge. The sculpture known as “Shark Girl”, depicting an innocent young girl with a bizarro shark head, had sat in that position for several years until just recently she was purchased and summarily transported to Buffalo, NY. Poor Shark Girl, we’ll miss you.

Despite criticizing the sales tax measure proposed by Hamilton County Commissioners, the board of the Cincinnati Museum Center voted last week to support an increase in sales tax to help pay for Union Terminalâ€™s much-needed repairs. Museum board members initially criticized the removal of Music Hall from the November ballot, which caused a loss of historic tax credits and private donations. The five-year increase in sales tax from 6.75 percent to 7 percent will be on the ballot this November and should raise close to $170 million for the repairs.

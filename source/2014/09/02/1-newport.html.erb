Development has resumed fifteen years after the dream of Newport on the Levee was proposed. The struggling Levee has lost an 3D iMax movie theater, suffered poor retail sales and seen a carousel of revolving tenants come through its doors since it opened. The new investment will contain both permanent and hotel spaces, which should increase traffic to the Leveeâ€™s remaining retail tenants.

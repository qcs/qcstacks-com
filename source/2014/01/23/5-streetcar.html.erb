Good news transit fans, the streetcar project is on budget and schedule per a recent report by project executive John Deatrick.  Also noted recently were estimated consumer pricing for riding said streetcar: $1.75 for two hours and $3.50 for 24 hours. At that price point, officials have projected 3,000 daily commuters but caution that these estimates do not take special events into account.

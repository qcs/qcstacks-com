If the Ohio Department of Transportation gets its way a 17-mile rail line would be constructed connecting residents living in Cincinnati&rsquo;s eastern suburbs to downtown. The rail line, currently dubbed the Oasis Line, would be done in four phases, &ldquo;from the Riverfront Transit Center to Montgomery Inn at the Boathouse, from the boathouse to Columbia Tusculum, from Columbia Tusculum to Fairfax/Red Bank Road, from Fairfax/Red Bank to Ancor and from Ancor to Milford,&rdquo; according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. More than 3,200 people are estimated to ride the proposed line daily if it is constructed.

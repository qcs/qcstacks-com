There hasn&rsquo;t been a shortage of controversy surrounding whether or not fracking contaminates drinking water in the media lately. The environmental effects caused by the process of extracting natural gas from shale deposits is the focus of a study currently being conducted by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. The researchers are taking water samples for the Utica Shale region of Carroll County, Ohio, which is about 250 miles northeast of Cincinnati. Since 2010 Ohio has received more than 190 complaints of contaminants in drinking water.

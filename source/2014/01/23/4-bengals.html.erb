Since we clearly don't have enough corporate sponsorship already and the owners of the Bengals franchise haven't bled every possible cent from county taxpayers, the team now wants naming rights for Paul Brown Stadium in exchange for not opposing certain new developments at the Banks. Naming rights can be a big deal and mean big money to professional sports teams, as evidenced by Citigroup's recent $400 million dollar endorsement of the New York Met's ballpark.

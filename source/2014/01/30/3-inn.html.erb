After a failed legal battle to remain in Lytle Park, work has begun today on the new location at Mount Auburn for the Anna Louise Inn. The Inn's owner, Cincinnati Union Bethel, lost a 2-year lawsuit with Western &amp; Southern to keep the Inn at Lytle Park, where it has been since 1909. Western &amp; Southern wanted the Inn moved to complete its development vision for Lytle Park. The $15-million project is expected to be completed by Spring of 2015.

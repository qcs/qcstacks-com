Four out of five of Ohio's lower-income fourth graders fall below reading proficiency standards, according to a report released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Higher-income fourth graders fared a bit better, however, with only 48 percent of the group falling below proficiency standards. The report comes on the heels as state officials are trying to implement the Third Grade Reading Gaurantee, which requires most Ohio third-graders to test at or above proficiency before they can advance to the fourth grade.

Cincinnati&rsquo;s acting City Manager Scott Stiles announced a big shake up in the city&rsquo;s core leadership positions this week. Most notably City Solicitor John Crup will leave his current position to head up the city&rsquo;s Metropolitan Sewer and Water districts. Some, including councilmembers P.G. Sittenfeld and Chris Seelbach, say the move was retribution from Mayor John Cranley as Crup favored both the parking privatization plan and the streetcar project, both of which Cranley was against. Bill Moller, a city retiree, was hired as the assistant city manager, which allows Moller to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; into pension and a new city salary at $147,000.

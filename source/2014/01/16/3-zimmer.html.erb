Another one bites the dust. On the heels of Jay Gruden leaving the Bengals to become the head coach for the Washington Redskins, defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer is packing his bags for Minnesota to become head coach for the Vikings. Zimmer has been with the Bengals since 2008. The Bengals announced former linebacker coach Paul Guenther will become the next defensive coordinator.

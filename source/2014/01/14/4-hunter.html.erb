Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter was indicted with eight felony charges Friday that carry a maximum prison sentence of 18 years. Hunter, who was immediately disqualified without pay by The Ohio Supreme Court, is alleged to have forged and backdated documents and of improperly helping her brother who was fired from juvenile court after punching a teen inmate. Retired County Juvenile Court Judge Tom Lipps has been appointed to help the court through April 10.

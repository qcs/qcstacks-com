Ed FitzGerald, the Democratic frontrunner in this year&rsquo;s governor race, announced he has selected Sharen Neuhardt to be his running mate. Neuhardt replaces State Sen. Eric Kearney who recently left the ticket after a string of stories shed light on some of his business-related financial problems. Neuhardt is a key defender of women&rsquo;s reproductive issues, especially abortion rights. She has waged two unsuccessful runs for the U.S. House in 2008 and 2012.

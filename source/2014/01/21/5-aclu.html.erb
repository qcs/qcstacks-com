It took convicted killer Dennis McGuire 26 minutes to die from Ohio&rsquo;s latest cocktail of drugs designed to end a person&rsquo;s life. It was the first time that exact mixture of drugs has been used for the death penalty in the United States. The length of the procedure -- which was Ohio&rsquo;s longest since the death penalty returned in 1999 -- prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to ask Gov. John Kasich to halt the death penalty across the state.

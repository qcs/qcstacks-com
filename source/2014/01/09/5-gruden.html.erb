The Cincinnati Bengals are in the market for a new offensive coordinator after Jay Gruden agreed to a 5-year deal to become the Washington Redskins&rsquo; head coach next season. Gruden has been with Bengals since 2011 and played a key figure in both seasons of HBO&rsquo;s Hard Knocks series that focused on the Bengals in training camp. Gruden&rsquo;s Bengals ranked 10th in total yards per game and sixth in points per game for the 2013 season.

Welcome to 2014, employees! Cincinnati-based retailer Macy&rsquo;s announced in a statement it will be laying off 2,500 employees in an effort to reduce costs and because of other organizational changes. The layoffs should save the mega-retailer about $100 million per year and all those affected by the layoffs will be eligible for severance. Despite the cost-cutting moves, Macy&rsquo;s is planning to add staff to other positions within the company, which should keep its workforce around 175,000.

Building upon the success of other farm-to-table operations, such as Columbus' North Market, Farm Fresh Books has announced a deal to create a locally inspired cookbook featuring vendors and recipes from Cincinnati's best kept secret, Findlay Market. With proceeds benefitting our historic public market, the cookbook is expected to debut in the 4th quarter of 2014. No vendors have been announced yet but the stated goal is to highlight all of Findlay's incredible food vendors. Yum!

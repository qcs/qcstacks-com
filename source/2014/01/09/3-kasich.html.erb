A report published in November showed Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate above the national average in September and October. This news should bring some firepower to Gov. John Kasich&rsquo;s adversaries during this election year. Upon taking office in 2010, Kasich claimed his tax cuts and privatization efforts would create economic growth for Ohio. The Buckeye State has dropped from 34th to 26th nationally in private-sector job growth since January 2010.

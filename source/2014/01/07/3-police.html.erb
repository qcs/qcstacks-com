An uptick in homicides in Over-the-Rhine toward the end of 2013 pushed Cincinnati's homicide rate to 15.5 per 100,000 for last year, which is more than 10 points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000. New Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell and Councilman Christopher Smitherman agreed the majority of the homicides were black-on-black and few were random in nature. Blackwell told City Council the department is "significantly short of police officers."

Owners of Over-the-Rhine's The Senate and Abigail Street restaurants are planning to open their third restaurant along Vine Street soon. The restaurant doesn't have a name yet, but will be a barbecue joint and will serve most meals for less than $11. The BBQ restaurant will be located in the old hardware store at 1403 Vine Street and will feature a fully-stocked bar with an emphasis on cocktails crafted with bourbon.

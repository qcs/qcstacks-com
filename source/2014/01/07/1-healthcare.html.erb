Following the loss of a federal grant which accounted for nearly 13% of its budget, Neighborhood Health Inc. was forced to close four clinics in the Greater Cincinnati area at the end of 2013. As a result, nearly 20,000 area patients will be left without access to medical services for at least the first quarter of the year. Among those affected are pregnant women receiving prenatal care and other	 patients suffering from severe conditions such as diabetes and chronic heart problems.

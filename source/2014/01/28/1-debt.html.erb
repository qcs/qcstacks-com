The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy investigation on the city&rsquo;s rising debt levels, which have increased threefold in the last 20 years.  One of John Cranley&rsquo;s promises when running for mayor was the completion of the Interstate 71 and Martin Luther King interchange project, which the city has already borrowed $20 million to help finish the project. It&rsquo;s of course unfair to blame Cranley for the city&rsquo;s rising debt, but his promises certainly don&rsquo;t help. Cincinnati is carrying an annual $1.1 billion debt, which means the city is paying $118 million per year in debt payments. Carrying debt isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, however, but it could mean bond agencies could downgrade the city&rsquo;s creditworthiness.

A bill approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio House would allow some school employees to carry concealed firearms at school and prohibit school boards from releasing the names of those who carry them. And just in case you thought the rules weren&rsquo;t lax enough, the bill also states if your child&rsquo;s gun-toting-history-teacher-turned-Dirty Harry mercenary kills someone, the rules exempt the school board and employees from liability &ldquo;unless the injury, death or loss resulted from the employee&rsquo;s reckless or wanton conduct.&rdquo; The bill has to pass the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate and be signed by pro-gun Gov. John Kasich before it becomes law.

Just because there aren&rsquo;t many fracking locations near Cincinnati doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t join in on the fun of experimenting with questionable chemicals. The U.S. Coast Guard is deciding as to whether or not to &ldquo;allow oil and gas companies to ship fracking wastewater on barges down the Ohio River,&rdquo; reports WCPO. Those in favor of shipping the chemicals on our mighty Ohio River maintain that transporting the chemical-and-sand-infused byproduct would be a boon to oil and gas companies&rsquo; bottom lines since they could instead send send one barge, which would carry as much waste as 20 trucks.

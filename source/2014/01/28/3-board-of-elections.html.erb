So Hamilton County needs a new crime lab and the Board of Elections has voiced some need in recent year to relocate, due to space. Could a mutual solution be to move the Board of Elections to the old crime lab space in Mt. Airy? Not so fast, say local democrats. The proposed move could place an undue burden on low-income voters who live downtown and lack the transportation to get out to vote come election time. Making matters worse, the county commissioners need to make a decision on this before the end of the month.

U.S. District Judge Gregory L. Frost extended a moratorium on Ohio&rsquo;s executions until Jan. 15 of next year, effectively saving the lives of three Ohio inmates on death row. The decision by Frost was prompted by the debate of the effectiveness of lethal-injection drugs. The drugs have caused problems in Ohio and several other states.

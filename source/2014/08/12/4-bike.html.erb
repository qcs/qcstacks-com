City leaders met this morning to unveil the first of Cincinnati&rsquo;s 35 bike sharing stations. Mayor John Cranley and the leaders of Queen City Bike, the organization behind the bike-share effort, said the process of finishing the stations should move quickly and be fully operational by September. Cranley previously announced $1.1 million in upfront capital costs to help fund the $2 million plan. The final pricing structure is not finalized yet, but prices should be $75 - $85 for annual memberships and anywhere between $6 - $8 for daily passes.

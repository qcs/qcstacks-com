More than two dozen downtown restaurants are participating in this year&rsquo;s Do Downtown Cincinnati Restaurant week, which kicked off Monday and runs through Sunday. Most of the participating restaurants offer a three-course meal for $35. The restaurants typically tend to book up quick, so itâ€™s best to make reservations well in advance.

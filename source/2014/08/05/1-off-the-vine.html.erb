Local health nuts are looking forward to a new, trendy option for quenching their thirst this fall, with the opening of Off the Vine, OTR's first cold-press juice bar. Following suit with other large city juicing outlets, Off the Vine will charge between $8 and $11 for their craft concoctions. Their mission goes beyond just filling thirsty throats; they plan to offer daily regimens for cleansing and local support for learning to live a healthier lifestyle.

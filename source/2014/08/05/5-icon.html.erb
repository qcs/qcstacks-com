Despite a 6-0 vote from City Council to put $10 million toward saving Music Hall and Union Terminal over 25 years, Hamilton County Commissioners might drop Music Hall from this fall's ballot. Commissioner Greg Hartmann said council members need to make a bigger commitment to saving the buildings before commissioners approve a quarter-cent sales tax increase for both. Commissioner Chris Monzel is in favor of booting Music Hall from the ballot as well, saying that Hamilton County only has ties to Union Terminal, home to the Museum Center.

On Monday, the Cincinnati Zoo reported the birth of a new baby gorilla. To date, zookeepers haven't been able to determine the sex of the baby due to the mother's attentiveness, constantly holding her new little one close. Born to an eleven year old Western Lowland gorilla named 'Asha', the new addition seems healthy and should be outside to greet visitors in the near future.

A $35,000 restitution order made in July against Dancing Wasabi’s owner Charlie Choi has forced the popular Hyde Park restaurant to close. The restitution order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by employees against Choi asking for unpaid minimum wages and overtime. Choi has moved on to manage the Mr. Sushi restaurant in downtown Cincinnati.

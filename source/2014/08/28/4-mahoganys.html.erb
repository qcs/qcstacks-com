Embattled restaurant Mahogany’s was shuttered again this week by the state for not paying its taxes. The long-troubled restaurant owes $61,338 to the State of Ohio, according to an investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer. In addition the the money the restaurant owes the state it also owes the City of Cincinnati about $28,000 in tax money from the $300,000 loan, which was part of the $1 million it received from the city while opening the restaurant. Mahogany’s owner, Liz Rogers, said Tuesday’s closure was a misunderstanding and hopes the have the restaurant opened again soon.

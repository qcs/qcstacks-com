The City of Cincinnati&rsquo;s health insurance program will begin to cover medically &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; transgender procedures beginning next year. The move will make Cincinnati the first city in Ohio to offer these benefits to employees. The move is an attempt to draw a diverse set of workers to the city. The City of Cincinnati also offers same-sex benefits to all city employees.

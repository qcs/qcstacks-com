Whether they were hoping to avoid a larger initial backlash or if the estimates were off, Duke has upped the official total of gallons of oil spilled into the Ohio River from their W.C. Beckjord Station in New Richmond to somewhere around 9,000 gallons. The original estimate was about 5,000 gallons. The Aug. 18 spill has affected a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River and crews are continuing to cleanup the energy company&rsquo;s mess.

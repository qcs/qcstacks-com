By now you've probably heard the reports of a man in Madeira accidentally shooting his wife on Tuesday with a deer hunting rifle. So far, the police and most of those familiar with the story are skeptical of the defense that the incident was simply an accident. It turns out that the couple had been arguing immediately before the incident and there were clothes and medications packed up in his car. Nonetheless, at his arraignment Wednesday, the subject entered a plea of not guilty.

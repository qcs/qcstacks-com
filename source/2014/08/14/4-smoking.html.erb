An area currently under construction at Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati that will house 150 slot machines and other gaming devices could allow smoking when construction is finished. If the Ohio Casino Control Commission approves the proposal, it would make Horseshoe the first of the three Ohio casinos to allow smoking inside. Casinos in Indiana allow smoking on the main gambling floor, and allowing smoking in designated areas should help Horseshoe remain competitive.

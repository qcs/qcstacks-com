Duke Energy Convention Center is planning a renovation to uncover a unique mosaic created by the late, locally beloved American Modernist painter Charlie Harper. The artwork had been covered up years ago because it didn't fit the contemporary decor. Because of Harper's growing popularity of late and the fact that this piece is much different than his traditional work, the Mayor, City Council and Hamilton County Commissioners are all jumping at the opportunity to unearth the mural.

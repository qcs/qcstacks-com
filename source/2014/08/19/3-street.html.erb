Nobody said this was going to be easy. The Cincinnati Streetcar Project received news that they are not receiving a $5 million federal grant to help pay for operating costs of the project. The loss of the funds is due to a poor rating from a regional transportation planning agency. It will cost close to $3.8 million to run the streetcar during its first full year of operation, and the project expects to post a $2 million deficit during that time period.

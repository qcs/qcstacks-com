Regional darlings, brothers Nick and Drew Lachey of boy-band and reality TV fame are opening a bar on Walnut Street in OTR and some A&amp;E cameras will be coming along for the ride. While the bar itself should be open sometime this fall, the reality docuseries which plans to capture all the hilarious antics along the way won't premier until sometime next year.

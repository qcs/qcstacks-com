Close to 5,000 gallons of oil from Duke Energy&rsquo;s W.C. Beckjord Station spilled into the Ohio River near New Richmond Monday morning. The mess will take several days to clean up, according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard closed a 15-mile section of the river near the spill until the oil can be removed. The spill is classified as a “medium-sized” spill as it falls within the range of 1,000 to 10,000 gallons.

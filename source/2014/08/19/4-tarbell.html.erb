Aside from having a his larger-than-life likeness plastered on a wall in OTR, former council member and vice mayor Jim Tarbell has always maintained a pretty visible presence in the downtown community. Most people know him and have met him and if you haven’t, you’ll probably have your chance at any of the dozens of community businesses and events he so frequently attends. For that reason, its not completely out of the realm of possibilities for him to truly shake-up local politics with his recent decision to file as a write-in candidate for Hamilton County Commissioner, opposite Republican incumbent Chris Monzel.

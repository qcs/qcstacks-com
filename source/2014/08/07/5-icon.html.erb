    Despite bringing thousands of people downtown for Lumenocity this past weekend, Music Hall will not be on the tax levy this fall when voters go to the polls to approve a 5-year, .25 percent sales tax increase to save Cincinnatiâ€™s landmark buildings. Republican Hamilton County Commissioners decided they would rather let the historic Music Hall slowly fade away than try to renovate the building to last another 100 years. The vote on Union Terminal is expected to raise $170 million over five years to renovate the landmark.

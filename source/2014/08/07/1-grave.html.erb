One local man can&rsquo;t let bygones be bygones as he urinated on the grave of former Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell. The man, Paul S. Serbu of Franklin, was issued a summons Wednesday by Baltimore County, Maryland after Serbu allegedly posted a video online showing him peeing on the grave wearing a Cleveland Browns jersey.

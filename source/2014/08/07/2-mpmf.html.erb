Late September marks the 13th installment of Midpoint Music Festival in OTR and the Central Business District. Beatniks and hipsters will abound citywide to catch any of the 150 performances distributed across the city. They also have a pretty sweet website that can you use to build a personal itinerary so you don't miss a thing.

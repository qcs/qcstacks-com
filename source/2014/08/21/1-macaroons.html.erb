The latest foodie craze is coming to OTR in the form of French-style, bite-size, almond or coconut-flavored macaroons. The new shop, the Macaron Bar, will be located next door to Park &amp; Vine on Main Street and is expected to open its doors in November. They'll serve traditional macaroons along side Deeper Roots coffee and teas from Essencha Tea House. Yum!

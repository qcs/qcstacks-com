If thereâ€™s one thing the Catholic Archdiocese are good for is its ability to cause guilt among large groups of people. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati asked principals at local Catholic schools not to encourage students to raise money for the ALS Association through the ice-bucket challenge because the association uses embryonic stem cells in its research. In order to harvest embryonic stem cells, an embryo must be destroyed and many Catholics relate that to abortion, which the Church is strongly against.

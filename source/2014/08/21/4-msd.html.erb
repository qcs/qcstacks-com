About 10 years ago, the federal government mandated that the Metropolitan Sewer District (aka MSD) perform billions of dollars of upgrades to the city's sewer system. The problem is that even though the city runs MSD, the county is charge of policy & spending and the two entities rarely see eye-to-eye. The latest example of this pissing match is that the county says the city isn't complying with a federal ruling from a few months ago stipulating that the county has the final say. If it sounds like a broken record, thats because it is... sigh.

Lavomatic Café, a cornerstone of the revitalization movement in OTR has closed. While this turn of events comes with some sadness for its faithful patrons, the writing was on the wall as many diners commonly opted for some of the newer additions to Vine Street's culinary lineup. Moving in to capitalize on the vacancy are the Lanni brothers who are responsible for some of Lavomatic's stiffest competition, the Eagle and Bakersfield. The concept for the new restaurant hasn't been finalized but the duo hopes to open by October.

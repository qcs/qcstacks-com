A Hamilton County magistrate ordered a Sharonville abortion clinic to shut its doors despite a judge&rsquo;s opinion that the clinic should remain open. The clinic was denied a request for an exemption of a state rule that requires outpatient surgery centers to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital. Since taking office in 2012, Gov. John Kasich has closed 7 of 14 abortion clinics in Ohio.

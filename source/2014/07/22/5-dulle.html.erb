Officials have released details of Brogan Dulle's autopsy report indicating no-foul play was involved in his death. Dulle, the subject of a massive, tri-state missing person's search disappeared last May in a seemingly random and surprising turn of events that ended in a vacant house next to his Clifton apartment building. Family and friends who knew him were stupefied and insisted that he was either kidnapped or murdered. Hopefully, this new detail can provide some closure for the many people who were touched by the story.

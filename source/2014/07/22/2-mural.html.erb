A new dramatic mural located in Over-the-Rhine’s Brewery District will help tell the story of Cincinnati’s brewing history when it is completed Aug. 1. The mural was designed by Keith Neltner and is being painted by Neltner and 14 others at 131 E. McMicken Avenue, home of the former Scmidt Brothers/Crown Brewery. It is the first of three art installations to honor the Brewing Heritage Trail.

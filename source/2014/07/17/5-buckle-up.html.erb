Buckle yourself in country music fans, this weekend is going to get rowdy. Starting tomorrow night, Sawyer Point is going to get a little bit country with the inaugural installment of Buckle Up, the second music festival to hit the tri-state in as many weeks. Fresh on the heels of the successful Bunbury shindig, the multi-stage riverfront event will host such headliners as Alabama, Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris and more.

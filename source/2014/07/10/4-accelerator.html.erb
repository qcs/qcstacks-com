There&rsquo;s a number of Internet accelerators in Cincinnati all of which trade their much-needed money for an equity stake in a start-up&rsquo;s business, but one accelerator focuses on manufactured phsyical products instead. First Batch is a four-month accelerator program that partners entrepreneurs with manufacturers and $8,000 in grant funding to jumpstart the production of a new product. Ohio Valley Beard Supply, a company that creates beard elixirs, and Switcher, which creates multiple camera controls, are just two of this year&rsquo;s crop of students at First Batch.

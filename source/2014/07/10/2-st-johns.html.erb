It seems like almost daily we hear about new developments and additions to OTR's landscape of funky art-boutiques, breweries and nightlife spots. Today's installment is a project that's been in the works for more than 12 yearsâ€“ a $4.5MM renovation of historic St. Johns church on Elm Street. The folks responsible envision a multipurpose meeting space for weddings and concerts as well as a public bar on the first floor.

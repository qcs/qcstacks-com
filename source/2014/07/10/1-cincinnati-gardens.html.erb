Cincinnati Gardens, the aging event venue that has stood for a generation was once home to such acts as the The Beatles and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. It's this heritage that CityBeat has highlighted in a recent post detailing the current state and history of the iconic venue that, while still active has been on a downward decline for some time. It's for sale too, in case you're interested.

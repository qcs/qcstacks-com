To literally no one's surprise- COAST, the local conservative group virulently opposed to taxes in any shape or form, has announced its plans to fight the proposed quarter percent sales tax increase currently being considered by Hamilton County Commissioners. The increase will go to fund rehabilitations of two of the city's most notable landmarks, Music Hall and Union Terminal. The group's chief argument is that the buildings are owned by the city and thus should not put county taxpayers on the hook for the repairs.

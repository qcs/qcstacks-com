A once-famous music venue will be returning to its roots after Olives on Ludlow announced their last opening day as a restaurant will be July 20. The building will be turned into a live music venue named Live at the Ludlow Garage, an homage to its famous namesake when it was run by Jim Tarbell in the early 1970s. The owners hope to have live acts performing by mid-November.

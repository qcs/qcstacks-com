Mayor John Cranley chose Balitmore&rsquo;s finance director Harry Black to become Cincinnati&rsquo;s next city manager. If City Council approves Cranley’s choice, Black will replace Interim City Manager Scott Stiles. Black’s nickname when he was chief financial officer of Richmond, Virginia was “Mr. Pitbull.” Black has plenty of experience in government, but never as a city manager.

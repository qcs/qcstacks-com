In a letter to the state of Ohio the University of Cincinnati suggested it should not have to pay taxes on the Emery Theater. The letter comes on the heels of a complaint filed by the Cincinnati Public Schools that says the Emery theater and apartment buildings should lose its tax-exempt status. CPS argued because the theater is no longer in use, it doesn&rsquo;t have an educational value for UC. If the state agrees with CPS, the theater would have an annual tax bill of $20,000 and 65 percent of that would go toward CPS.

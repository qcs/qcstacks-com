The City of Cincinnati improperly borrowed money from neighborhood projects to pay its taxes to Cincinnati Public Schools and now has to repay the $4 million, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. A Hamilton County judge ruled that the creative, unlawful financing the city loaned itself cannot be replicated in the future. The money should be a welcome to relief the 12 communities missing funds. A final judgement for when the city must pay the $4 million back will be determined Aug. 8.

Common core? More like common score! Maybe not for the Ohio lawmakers who want to repeal the state&rsquo;s use of national standards and replace them with new standards. Republican Speaker Pro Tempore Matt Huffman introduced a bill that has been fast-tracked to committee that would repeal the standards being implemented at schools starting in August. If the bill were to pass the Ohio House, it would need to be also passed by the Ohio Senate and escape a veto from Gov. John Kasich, an ally of the Common Core.

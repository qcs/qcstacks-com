In the recent hubbub surrounding the whether tax payers are on the hook for rehabilitation of two of the city's most notable icons, Mayor Cranley has relented a bit and pledged to double the city's commitment to the effort. The Mayor has agreed to a restitution payment of $200,000 over 25 years, bringing the city's total investment $20 million dollars.

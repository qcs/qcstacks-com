This weekend marks the second annual installment of LumenoCity, the projection-mapped extravaganza set against historical Music Hall in OTR. The event that kicked-off last year to widespread fanfare has been working full-tilt to provide an experience as exciting as last years, with the first performance kicking off Friday. Upping the ante, organizers have been working with local ad-agency Topic to bring an interactive application for fans.

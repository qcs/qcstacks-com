Two people each will be given $100,000 to quit their jobs and chase their dreams of making a difference in the community. The application for the Haile Fellowship grants will be run by People&rsquo;s Liberty, which will headquartered at the Globe building across from Findlay Market. In addition to a monetary grant, the foundation will provide would-be philanthropists a work place, support staff and expert advice on how to navigate local government and businesses.

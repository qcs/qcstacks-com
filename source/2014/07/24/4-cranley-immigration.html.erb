While the federal government is in the middle of a immigration crisis on it's southern border, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley has announced that he wants the city to be most immigration-friendly city in the country. For his part, the Mayor has put together a task force to help encourage immigration to the tri-state, putting him squarely at odds with Speaker of the House John Boehner.

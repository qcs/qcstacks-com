The Ohio State University fired its marching band director after finding a persistent &ldquo;sexual culture&rdquo; propagated by Jonathan Waters. The two-month investigation started after a parent complained that several students often sexually harassed one another and Waters either knew about it or should have known about it. The report also describes the band marching across the field in their underwear while Waters and his staff watched.

Hamilton County Commissioners convened yesterday as audience to a standing-room-only crowd as supporters and opponents of a proposed 0.25%, 9 year sales-tax increase was debated. The tax revenue is intended to help fund the rehabilitation of two of the city's most iconic buildings, Music Hall and Union Terminal. One particular issue of note is that even though the city technically owns the two buildings, it has only pledged $10 million to the effortâ€“ approximately 3% of the total price tag.

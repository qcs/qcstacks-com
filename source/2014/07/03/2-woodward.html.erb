The owners of MOTR Pub in OTR are one step closer to finalizing plans for rehabilitation of the historic Woodward Theatre. Yesterday they announced they had secured the final $1.25 MM in funding they need to complete the project. The venue, which will seat about 600 people and is located directly across Main Street from MOTR is expected to house musical performances as early as this fall.

Local design firm KZF Design released a study on Wasson Way that concluded construction of Wasson Way Trail would cost around $7.5 million for a walking and biking trail and $36 million for a light rail line adjacent to the trail. KZF estimated the trail would connect eight Cincinnati neighborhoods and about 100,000 residents with more than 100 miles of trail.

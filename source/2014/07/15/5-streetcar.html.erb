Despite its tumultuous start, the Cincinnati streetcar project is on budget and on time. Construction on the $133-million project has been steady for a year, but with an opening date of 2016 there is still plenty of work to be done. The streetcar and its 3.6 mile route will cost about $3.8 million in annual revenue costs. Keep your eyes peeled for Sept. 15, 2016 when the project&rsquo;s first riders are scheduled to board.

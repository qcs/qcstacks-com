Plans to turn Eden Park&rsquo;s dilapidated, run-down 19th century water pump station into a brewery are on hiatus until City Council and Mayor John Cranley can come together on a deal for the property. Council and Cranley shelved the deal to give the property to its potential owners for $1 and would protect the city from owning the building if the brewery would fail. The owners of the potential brewery hope to get a vote scheduled to move things along on Aug. 6.

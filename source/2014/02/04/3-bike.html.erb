Cincinnati is jumping on the bike sharing bandwagon as 20 bike stations will appear throughout Over-the-Rhine and downtown this summer. The program, dubbed Cincy Cycle, will charge an annual membership between $75 - $85 for unlimited use of the bikes to get around downtown. Nonmembers will be able to rent a bike for $7 or $8 per day.

Cincinnati's top budget, finance and pension officials outlined Monday that the city's budget will start out in a $21 million hole. The city expects to raise about $356 million in tax and other revenue, but estimates spending $377 million. This news comes just before the Cincinnati officials plan to meet with bond ratings agencies who determine the city's credit rating. According to WVXU, the city has spent more than it has earned for several years and covered the difference with one-time revenue sources.

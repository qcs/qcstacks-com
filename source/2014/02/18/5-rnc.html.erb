WVXU is reporting that local GOP leaders are lobbying the RNC to make Cincinnati the 2016 venue for the Republican National Convention. The plan is to have US Bank Arena host the event, which could bring thousands of Republican supporters into town. In order to make the effort a success though, conservatives will have to raise some money, and lots of it.

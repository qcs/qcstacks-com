There's been a flurry of microbrewery activity in Cincinnati lately and Sam Adam's, the nation's largest-selling craft beer manufacturer, doesn't want to be left out. The Boston-based brewery is adding more than $6 million to its brewing operations in Cincinnati's West End neighborhood, including a $3.5 million storage building and $2.3 million worth of storage tanks. Interested brewers take note: the facility has eight open positions at its Cincinnati facility.

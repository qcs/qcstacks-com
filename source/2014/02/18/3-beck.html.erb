Republican State Rep. Peter Beck faces 69 felony charges alleging he took hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors when he was chief financial officer of a failed West Chester software startup. The indictment alleges Beck, who is now under pressure to resign, diverted most of the money for his campaign fund. If convicted, the 61-year-old Beck could face up to 102 years in prison.

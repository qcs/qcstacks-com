It looks like Mayor John Cranley's proposed parking plan has enough votes on City Council to pass. Details of the new plan include: increasing downtown enforcement hours until 9 p.m.; upping neighborhood meter rates by 25&ndash;75c; and upgrading all meters to accept credit cards. If the city decides to opt out of its lease with the Port Authority it will lose a one-time windfall of $85 million and cost taxpayers $1 million to pull out of the lease.

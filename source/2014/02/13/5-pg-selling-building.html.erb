Hey investors, want to own a piece of prime real-estate downtown? Then look no further than the corner of Sycamore and 6th where Proctor and Gamble has listed a 110,000 square foot office building for $6.5 million. P&G employees and existing tenants will be fully relocated by November. One existing tenant, startup incubator Centrifuse is planning to move to OTR; no word on what plans for the Port Authority are.

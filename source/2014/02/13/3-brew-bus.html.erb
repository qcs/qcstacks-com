Forget the taxis, craft beer fans– check out the Cincy Brew Bus, a new venture that provides cross-city transportation for sudsy samples at 6 different local breweries. In addition to adult-beverages, the shuttle will also provide en-route education on Cincinnati's extensive brewing history as well as an update on the recent local resurgence. We’re anxious to see some of the city’s newest players (Rhinegeist & Ei8ht Ball) added to the list of destinations, but this looks like a great start!

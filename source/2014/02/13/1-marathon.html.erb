Those looking for a 4-legged companion to run with them as part of this year's Flying Pig festivities are in luck: The IAMS Flying Fur run will take place Saturday May 3, at 1:30 p.m. The 2-mile route starts near the Purple People Bridge and IAMS will donate a bag of pet food to the SPCA Cincinnati for each dog registered for the event.

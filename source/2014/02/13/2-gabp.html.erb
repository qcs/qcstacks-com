Speaking of craft beer, thirsty baseball fans may soon have even more options to wash down those peanuts whilst imbibing at Great American Ballpark. Business Courier reports that the GABP's craft offerings could soon expand to 30 taps! In addition, there are also rumors of more focus on social media, which may include concepts similar to Cleveland's Social Suite for the most socially engaged fans.

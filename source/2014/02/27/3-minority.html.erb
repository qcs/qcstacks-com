Mayor John Cranley has the votes he needs to set up an Office for Minority Inclusion at City Hall and $175,000 to spend on a consultant to study the city&rsquo;s minority contracting. Both initiatives are a result of the city&rsquo;s poor record of rewarding contracts to minority- and female-owned businesses. Last year the city awarded three percent of contracts to African-American owned businesses, six percent to women-owned businesses and none to Hispanic contractors, according to WVXU.

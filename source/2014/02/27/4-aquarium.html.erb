Newport Aquarium is making shark-ray headlines again. In just over a month, all seven recently born pupsâ€“ the first ever born in captivity, have died. The facility has been working towards the goal of breeding the extremely rare species since it created the Shark Ray Breeding Progam in 2007, so the loss is a disappointing turn.

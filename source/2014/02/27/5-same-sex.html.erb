The mayor and city-council are poised to help local small businesses offer benefits to same-sex couples by expanding the city's domestic partner registry. Spearheaded by Councilman Seelbach, the registry will be funded entirely by application fees and will help Cincinnati achieve a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign "Municipal Equality Index".

The closing of four community health clinics impacting as many as 10,000 children and adults could have been a result of spiteful letter sent by the health department who operated the clinics, according to Mayor John Cranley. The letter was sent to federal regulators and may have impacted their decision not to renew funding for the Neighborhood Health Care centers in Walnut Hills, Norwood, Harrison and Downtown. The letter, dated October 14, 2013 and signed by the health department&rsquo;s chief financial officer Joyce Tate, criticized a merger with Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s HealthPoint as a way to prop up the financially struggling Neighborhood Health Centers.

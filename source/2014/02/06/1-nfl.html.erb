About $1.5 million worth of counterfeit NFL merchandise was seized by Federal agents last week at CVG, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. The items included fake jerseys, caps, T-shirts and other souvenirs. The bust was part of a larger national sting that netted more than $21.6 million in counterfeit merchandise.

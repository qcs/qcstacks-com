A chief economist at PNC Financial group estimated Cincinnati's economy should add more than 10,000 jobs this year. Despite the big number, it's not really all that much to be excited about. The Cincinnati area added somewhere between 8,000 - 9,000 jobs last year, which puts this year's predictions at a 1.5 percent growth rate compared to the national average of 3 percent.

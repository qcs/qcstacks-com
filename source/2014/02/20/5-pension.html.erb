Councilman Smitherman has issued a proposal to resolve the looming pension crisis in Cincinnati. It includes a number of previously voiced suggestions such as freezing cost of living adjustments as well as call for the city to cough-up a one-time $100 million. Once the program is solvent, he'd look to transfer everything to the state retirement system, similar to how other cities in Ohio operate.

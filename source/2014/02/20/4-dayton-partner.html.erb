Mayor John Cranley has announced that he'll be partnering with Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley to compete for federal funds to attract new manufacturing businesses to the area. There is apparently $1.3 billion up for grabs, and the two city leaders hope to be named among 12 benefactors across the nation. Cranley also noted that whether or not the partnership is a success for this specific initiative, it should help foster future regional relationships to benefit both communities.

Mayor John Cranley is adamant about retaining control of the city's parking system. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, Xerox proposed to overhaul the city's parking meters to include smarter technology that would allow customers to pay by their phones. Xerox claims their plan would allow the city to generate $1 million more per year than the current plan, but would require the city to take on more debt to initially implement. Cranley is against having an outside company manage the meters and appears to have support to pass his version of the parking plan.

A favored plan amongst gun enthusiasts, the question of whether or not to arm educators to discourage violence in schools is currently being debated in Boone County, KY. The program under consideration, "Protecting Our Students and Teachers" was created by Boone County Constable Joe Kalil following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Kalil says that arming teachers will deter any future plans for attack; some parents and teachers disagree.

Mayor John Cranley is looking for five votes on Cincinnati City Council to approve his recommended plan for the city's parking system. Under Cranley's plan the city's Parking Services Department would continue to run the maintenance and operation of the city's meters and garages, according to The Cincinnati Business Courier. The plan calls for about $25	 million in revenue bonds to improve the city's parking systems and expects an eventual return of $7.4 million per year.

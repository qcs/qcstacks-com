Despite an annual intake of $92 million, some businesses at The Banks are struggling, according to a detailed investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Those struggling businesses complain that the area is missing key pieces such as a hotel, office tower or grocery store. There's some hope for the businesses, however, with a 291 apartments and 19,000 square-feet of retail space planned for development soon, which will bring the total amount spent by taxpayers to $127.7 million.

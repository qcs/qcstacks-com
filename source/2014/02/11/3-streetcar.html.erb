Pro-streetcar advocates are plotting to expand the streetcar's route another mile toward Uptown despite mounting challenges from detractors. A number of challenges including an important power line to the city that runs underneath Vine Street and an unbudging Mayor John Cranley threaten derail the plans of connecting Downtown to Uptown. Streetcar supporters maintain that connecting the two key business districts is crucial for the system's long-term success. John Deatrick, who is managing the streetcar project, said he and his team are currently figuring out if completing Uptown route will keep the project on its $128 million budget.

The annual parade for the Cincinnati Red's Opening Day will be taking the scenic route this year due to ongoing construction along Race Street. In its 95th year, the parade will come south down Elm before hanging a left on Fifth Street to rejoin the normal route that runs alongside Fountain Square. The festivities kick-off at noon with the Redlegs facing the St. Louis Cardinals later that afternoon.

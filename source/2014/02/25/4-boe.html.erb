  The Hamilton County Board of Elections is moving from Downtown to Mt. Airy. The vote to move the BOE was divided along party lines and decided by Republican Ohio Secretary of State, John Husted. When the office moves in several years it will make Hamilton County the first urban county in Ohio not to have its election offices downtown. Democrats fear the move will restrict early voting for those living downtown without access to a car. It would take roughly two hours by bus to make the round-trip commute from Government Square to the new election offices.

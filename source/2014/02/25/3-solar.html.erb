Cincinnati's going green in 2014, thanks to renewed effort by the Office of Environment and Sustainability. The group, tasked with leading the municipal government towards  environmental stewardship, recently noted that upcoming projects will build on the advances the city made in solar energy in 2012. With a stated goal of doubling its ability to generate energy from solar power on government buildings by 2020, there's clearly lots to do.

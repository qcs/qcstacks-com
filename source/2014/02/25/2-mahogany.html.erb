After a long-fought financial battle the soul-food restaurant Mahogany&rsquo;s will default on its lease at the Banks. The restaurant owes nearly $53,000 in rent and utilities, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. Mahogany&rsquo;s received a $300,000 loan from the city to help with the costs of initial construction. It has not paid the city what it owes for November and December and made a partial payment in January.

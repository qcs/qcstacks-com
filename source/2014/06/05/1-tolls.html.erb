While tolls for the Brent Spence bridge replacement are an impending reality, at least one state is striving to make them as painless as possible. According to Business Courier, new legislation allowing for all-electronic tolling in the state of Ohio is headed to the Governor's desk for final approval. The implications? Hopefully any traffic imposed as a result of new toll-booths adjacent to the bridge will be eased. Ohâ€“ you'll also be photographed as you drive through the unmanned booths, so any violators beforewarned: you will be summarily subjected to public and monetary scrutiny.

A bill sponsored by suburban Cincinnati Republican John Becker would make it illegal for insurance providers to cover abortions even in cases of rape, incest and when a pregnancy threatens a mother&rsquo;s life. The bill, which had its first hearing yesterday, would also ban insurance coverage for public employees for birth control by means of intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs. Becker said he believed IUDs are considered an abortion, despite admitting he based that opinion on absolutely no medical evidence.

The Over-the-Rhine Community Council sent a letter to Mayor John Cranley to hold off on ceding 35 properties north of Liberty to 3CDC. Council President Ryan Messer said if 3CDC were awarded the buildings they would not be able to develop them fast enough and urged the mayor to instead award the buildings to smaller independent outfits.

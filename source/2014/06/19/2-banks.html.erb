Things are about to get a lot more crowded at The Banks. General Electric announced it will locate its new Global Operations Center at The Banks, according to The Cincinnati Business Courier. GE was also considering Oakley Station and Mason as locations for their operations center. GE will receive roughly $51.6 million tax credit spread out over 15 years from the the Ohio Tax Credit Authority.

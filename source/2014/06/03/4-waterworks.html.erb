According to Business Courier, Cincinnati WaterWorks is ready to raise rates, yet again. This time, they're looking for 7.5% or roughly $17 per household, per year. According to officials, this increase is a result of average usage being down slightly and would allow the organization to maintain a balanced budget and triple-A bond rating. Council reaction was mixed, with some members questioning the annual move to raise rates, year after year. According to Councilman Winburn, rates for the organization have steadily increased 38% for the last 8 years.

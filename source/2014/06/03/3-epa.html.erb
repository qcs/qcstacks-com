President Barack Obama unveiled new EPA guidelines Monday and put Ohio&rsquo;s coal-fired power plants under the gun to clean up their acts. The proposal would mandate a 28 percent reduction in carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity by 2030, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Despite being a nationwide proposal, Ohio is particularly hard-hit by these regulations because nearly 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s energy comes from coal-fired plants.

Cincinnati City Councilman Chris Seelbach introduced a measure to establish a domestic partnership registry that would help pave the way for same-sex couples to possibly qualify for equal employee benefits. The measure unanimously passed council&rsquo;s Human Services Committee and is slated to be voted on by full council Wednesday. Couples looking to qualify for the program would need to show strong financial interdependency.

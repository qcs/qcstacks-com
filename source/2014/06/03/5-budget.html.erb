Despite Mayor John Cranley trying to fast-track the passage of his city budget, some City Council members are crying foul that it&rsquo;s the first budget since 2001 to not be structurally sound. The dissenting Council members&rsquo; main complaints center around Cranley using one-time revenue sources to balance the budgets that may not be available in the future. In addition to the revenue controversy, the budget cuts $1.6 million to &ldquo;enterprise technology solutions&rdquo; that could lead toward software security breaches and compromise health records, income tax returns, traffic lights and other public services.

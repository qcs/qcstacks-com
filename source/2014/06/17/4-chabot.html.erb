Steve Chabot&rsquo;s efforts to slash Section 8 funding by 10 percent failed last week by a vote of 279-to-127. Chabot&rsquo;s wish to cut $3 billion from low-income housing comes at a time when Cincinnati&rsquo;s need for low-income vouchers is on the rise. Chabot has said he is against Section 8 housing because it leads to increased crime and lower property values in neighborhoods with a lot of low-income tenants.

This August, a regulation that has governed the boundaries of the Lytle Park Historic District since 1964 is set to expire. Members of City Council are working hard to prevent that from happening and may vote on whether to grant an extension as early as this week. The extension will likely cover a smaller geographic area than the original boundary did; in the years since the initial designation, the district has shrunk due to a lack of regulations in the neighborhood.

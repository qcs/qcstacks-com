Plans to renovate Lytle Park are coming closer to Western &amp; Southern Financial Group&rsquo;s goals. Cincinnati City Council&rsquo;s Neighborhoods Committee approved plans for new boundaries for the park on Monday, which will allow Western &amp; Southern to easier demolish and redevelop properties near the park.

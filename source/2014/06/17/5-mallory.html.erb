State Representative Dale Mallory failed to report an Indian Hill’s lobbyists gifts of Bengals tickets and expensive dinners, according to an ethic investigation. Mallory, along with several other lawmakers, attended a December, 2009 Bengal’s playoff game that was paid for by John Rabenold of Axcess Financial. The next month the lawmakers also dined at Via Vite and Lindey’s in Columbus on Rabenold’s dime. Rabenold was fined $2,000 for providing gifts to lawmakers.

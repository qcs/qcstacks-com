Former Bengals cheerleader Sarah Jones lost her defamation lawsuit against a gossip website where a user posted she had sex with half of the team&rsquo;s players. Jones had been awarded $338,000 by a lower court, which was overturned by 6th a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel. The court case, website, TheDirty.com, and its owner, Nik Richie, have been watched by online companies such as Google, eBay and Amazon because of its implications under the Communications Decency Act.

Cincinnati jazz institution The Blue Wisp closed its doors Saturday, according to WCPO. In 2012 the club moved from its location on Eighth Street to the corner of Seventh and Race Streets and began offering dinner, lunch and Sunday brunch. Employees blamed the club&rsquo;s changing business model for its closure. It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not the club will reopen at another location.

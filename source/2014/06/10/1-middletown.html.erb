  The city of Middletown has been acting for years to push out its poor citizens, according to documents obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Middletown officials have enacted a series of measures including threatening tenants with losing housing assistance if they have delinquent water bills from years past, putting  “problematic” landlords through special audits and background checks all in favor of reducing the amount of low-income housing available in Middletown. The Middletown Public Housing Agency is currently under a civil rights review by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

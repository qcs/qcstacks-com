On Thursday, Mayor John Cranley discussed his vision for a revitalized uptown area and highlighted the changes he'd like to see made to the area surrounding UC Campus. Chief among them, he envisions a safer campus environment, building upon the relationship between metro and UC police officers. Likewise, Cranley would like to see a more walking and biking paths in Burnett Woods, and even a pedestrian walkway above MLK drive.

Tickets for the upcoming LumenoCity event sold out within 12 minutes Monday and Vice Mayor David Mann wants to investigate if the tickets were distributed fairly. The city decided to offer free tickets after attendees at last year&rsquo;s event experienced overcrowding. Mann&rsquo;s calls for an investigation were prompted by some tickets being sold for $49 - $199 on eBay.

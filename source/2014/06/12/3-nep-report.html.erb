On Thursday, Mayor John Cranley is expected to release a progress report on the revitalization of East Price Hill, a three-month collaborative effort aiming to reduce crime and improve the quality of life for it's residents. The Neighborhood Enhancement Program is a attempt to 'turbo-charge' redevelopment over 90 days, following an accidental death of an eight year old boy in March.

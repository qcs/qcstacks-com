When Kentucky lawmakers recently failed to secure proper funding for the Brent Spence Bridge replacement project and even attempted to ban the use of toll-booths statewide, Ohio Governor John Kasich took note. And after signing legislation yesterday that paves the way for Ohio's investment in the same project, he signaled to his southern counterparts that its time to get real. He called Kentucky's lack of movement on the issue "unacceptable" and termed the project a major initiative for the entire region. Get it together, Kentucky!

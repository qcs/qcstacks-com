City Council passed legislation Wednesday to move forward to help fund for-profit Cincy Bike Lanes with their mission to spread the benefits of biking across the Queen City. The motion passed by council gives the startup $1.1 million to jump start their operation, but the group estimates needing another $1 million to get fully off the ground. Once funded the bike sharing program hopes to have 300 bikes available for rent from 35 stations across downtown, Over-the-Rhine and uptown.

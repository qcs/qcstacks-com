Hamilton County Commissioners will soon consider raising the county&rsquo;s 6.75 percent sales tax to fund much-needed improvement construction projects at Union Terminal and Music Hall. The sales tax hike proposal was put forth by the Cultural Facilities Task Force, a group of high-powered community and business leaders including former chairman and CEO of Proctor & Gamble, Bob McDonald. A cost estimate done by The Cincinnati Enquirer reported close to $150 million was needed to repair the ailing Union Terminal while a $100 million was required for Music Hall.

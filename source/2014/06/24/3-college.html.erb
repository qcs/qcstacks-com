Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald will be courting younger voters when he takes on John Kasich for governor of Ohio this fall. FitzGerald announced his desires to expand a college savings program he launched as a Cuyahoga County executive. The plan would place $100 of public money into a kindergartener&rsquo;s account. The money could only be used on college expenses. The goal of the program is to help people to start saving for college earlier and to plant the seed in children&rsquo;s minds that college is a destination that everyone can attend.

Mayor John Cranley wants to extend the timeline for Interim City Manager Scott Stiles' contract through the end of August, according to a report by Business Courier. The mayor cites the budget and other development deals as the primary cause for delay in his recommendation for a permanent replacement. The extension will require a vote by City Council, which already has a pretty hectic schedule ahead of it.

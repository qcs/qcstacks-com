A study looking at how much it would cost annually to operate the forthcoming Cincinnati streetcar found the amount would be higher than it was projected in December. The study found that the new annual operating cost would be $2.6 million in 2017 and rise to $3.85 million by 2025. The original costs were expected to be between $1.88 million and $2.44 million. Another report done by internal auditing firm KPMG estimated annual operating costs to be $4 million in 2017 and up to $5.56 million in 2025.

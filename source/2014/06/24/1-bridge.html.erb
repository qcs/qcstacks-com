Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell proposed ending the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act that regulates prevailing wages on federally funded projects as a way to help pay for the Brent Spence Bridge Project. It&rsquo;s highly unlikely McConnell&rsquo;s idea would pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, but he claims it would have saved $13 billion over 10 years. Alison Lundergan Grimes, McConnell&rsquo;s challenger for his Senate seat this fall, proposed paying for the bridge by eliminating some tax breaks for corporations.

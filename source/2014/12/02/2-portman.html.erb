You can cross Senator Rob Portman’s name off the list as a 2016 presidential candidate. The Republican Portman announced that he will run for a second term in the U.S. Senate in 2016 instead. The 59-year-old Portman first won election to the Senate by defeating Democrat Lee Fisher for George Voinovich’s vacant seat.

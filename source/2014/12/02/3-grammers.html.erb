The owner of Rookwood Property is planning a $75 million investment in Over-the-Rhine centered around the historic Grammer’s German restaurant at Walnut and Liberty streets. Martin Wade bought Grammer’s from Jim Tarbell in 2007 and has been steadily snatching up nearby property. Wade’s three-part plan is for 100 apartments, 40,000 square feet of offices and a row townhomes. Twenty-one initial apartments set to open in June 2015 are part of the project’s first phase.

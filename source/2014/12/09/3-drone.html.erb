The Hamilton County Sheriff recently purchased a drone to be used for aerial photos of crime scenes and traffic accidents. Hamilton County’s drone isn’t the first in the area, as other departments around Cincinnati have used similar drones for similar reasons. The drone is available for purchase from Amazon for $800.

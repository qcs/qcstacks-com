The presidents of the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati State met with U.S. President Barack Obama this week to brainstorm ideas how to bring more African-American students to science, math and engineering programs. UC plans to create a summer bridge program for Hughes STEM High School students next summer that will keep them on track to go to college. Likewise, Cincinnati State plans to expand their dual enrollment program that helps students earn college credit while attending high school.

Former juvenile court Judge Tracie Hunter was back in court this week trying to get a new trial on the grounds that the jury foreman in her initial trial was molested by a pastor as a child and could be prejudiced against pastors, which Hunter is. The judge denied Hunterâ€™s motion and is set to sentence her at 10 a.m. Friday.

Kayaking, canoeing and rowing could soon replace Jeff Rubyâ€™s Waterfront on the Ohio River. The Covington City Commission votes today on an agreement with the non-profit rowing group who proposed the idea. The Waterfront restaurant was closed in 2011 after it partially broke loose from its dock and floated down the Ohio River.

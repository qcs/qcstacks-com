Walnut Hills’ newest drinking establishment, Myrtle’s Punch House, is set to open Nov. 28 at 7 p.m. The drinkery is the brainchild of Molly Wellman — who also owns Japp’s, Neon’s and Old Kentucky Bourbon Bar through Wellman Brand — and will specialize in handcrafted punch, according to City Beat. The Punch House is located at DeSales Corner.

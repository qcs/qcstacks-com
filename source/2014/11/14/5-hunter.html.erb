Tracie Hunter’s long, strange journey took another turn this week when a third juror recanted their guilty verdict. The juror’s announcement comes on the heels of two other jurors who also recanted their guilty verdicts after implying the other jurors pressured them to convict Hunter. All three jurors who recanted their votes are black and the most recent juror to recant said she was racially pressured by the white jury foreman to convict. A decision will be made next week if Hunter receives a new trial.

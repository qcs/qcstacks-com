Cincinnati is one of 38 cities in the United States to receive a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign on its municipal equality index. The score reflects a cityâ€™s laws and policies protecting sexual and gender identity. Some of the reasons the group gave Cincinnati such high marks is because it extended benefits to same-sex partners of city employees and its requirement that all city contractors sign non-discrimination agreements.

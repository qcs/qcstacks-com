A bill passed a panel in the Ohio House this week prohibiting abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected. Since a heartbeat can be detected as early as six weeks, some pregnant women who might seek an abortion could not even know they are pregnant before their window has lapsed. The American Civil Liberties Union said they will challenge the bill in court if it were to make it into law.

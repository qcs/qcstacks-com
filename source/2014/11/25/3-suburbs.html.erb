African-Americans are 12 times more likely to be arrested than people of other races in Sharonville, according to an analysis by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Sharonville unfortunately doesn’t stand alone in how police treat African-Americans in Cincinnati’s suburbs. In the aggregate, African-Americans are two and a half times more likely to be arrested than other races by suburban police officers.

For the second time since August, HAZMAT crews were called to Duke’s Beckjord Station for a chemical spill. Two ounces of hydrazine was spilled from the plant, which is slated to close in January 2015. The Pierce Township Fire Department said they cleared the spill immediately and was nowhere close in size to the 9,000 gallons of fuel that were spilled into the Ohio River in August.

CVG has officially banned ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft from picking up travelers at the airport. Uber and Lyft arrived in Cincinnati last spring and are also banned in several other airports across the county. CVG officials say they are in talks with the two companies to become part of the airportâ€™s official ground-transportation system, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. There are no restrictions on ride-sharing companies dropping off people at the airport.

The second-oldest bar downtown, O’Malley’s in the Alley, will soon have a sister location as owner Juan Imeroni plans to open The Blind Pig, a Prohibition-themed bar. The name comes from a slang term people used to call speakeasies. The Bling Pig will have 20 beers on tap and will open the first week of December.

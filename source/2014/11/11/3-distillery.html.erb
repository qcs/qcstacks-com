Despite the craft brewery boom in Cincinnati, the Queen City is severely lacking in liquor production. Thankfully the owner of Pet Wants, Michele Hobbs, wants to remedy that problem by opening a distillery in Over-the-Rhine in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse and attached garage. The new distillery will be named Born Again Distillery and will produce gin, whiskey and bourbon.

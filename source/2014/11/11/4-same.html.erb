Same-sex couples in favor of marriage in Ohio, Kentucky and Michigan were dealt a 2-1 defeat yesterday by the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The court voted to uphold laws banning same-sex marriage. This comes as a setback for proponents of same-sex marriage who have been seeing a wave of victories in federal courts.

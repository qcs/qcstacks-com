You can thank Republic Bill Seitz for easing your anxiety when speeding through red lights. Seitz has been on a crusade since 2006 to eliminate red light and speed cameras in Ohio. A recent bill requires a police officer to man every camera in order to issue a ticket, effectively banning the cameras. The bill passed the Ohio Senate 24-9 and moves onto the House.

Love him or hate him, you can’t deny Carl Linder’s impact on Cincinnati. Cincinnati City Council unanimously voted to name 3rd Street “Carl H. Linder Way” after the financier who died in 2011. Linder donated millions to the city’s charities, but also gave a ton of money to a group that passed one of the country’s harshest anti-gay ordinances, Article XII, that restricted laws protecting LGBT residents.

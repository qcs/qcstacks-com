A judge denied Tracie Hunter’s request for a new trial despite three jurors recanting their guilty verdicts. Hunter was convicted of having an unlawful interest in a public contract involving her brother who was fired for punching a teen inmate in the face. Hunter’s sentencing date has yet to be scheduled.

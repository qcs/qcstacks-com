Think some of your work meetings go on longer than they need to? You wonâ€™t find any sympathy from members of the Cincinnati Historic Conservation Board who spent close to 7 hours discussing the fate of two historic Over-the-Rhine buildings. The board reached a decision Monday to prevent the demolition of the buildings located near the corner of Central Parkway and Main Street. The owner is pushing to demolish the buildings because he said it would be too expensive to remodel.

Members of Cincinnati City Council want to shake up the funds allocated toward certain non-profits, according The Cincinnati Enquirer. Funding for mentoring initiatives, after-school programs and a program that helps prostitutes get off the street would be cut entirely unless council votes to raise the $1.5 million general fund budget for these type of projects to $3 million.

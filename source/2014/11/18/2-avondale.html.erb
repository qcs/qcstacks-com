A 45-year-old man pleaded guilty last week to locking up and abusing a dozen women in his Avondale house. Christopher Hisle also sold the women as prostitutes in Cincinnati and neighboring cities. Hisleâ€™s neighbors said they were flabbergasted when they heard the news and described Hisle as quiet.

Changing federal drone laws and a giant nearby warehouse could make the Cincinnati area one of the first regions to take place in Amazonâ€™s Prime Air delivery service. The company is looking for pilots with five years of experience flying drones to staff up its service. If the Hebron fulfillment center were to be selected as part of the program, the drones could reach Cincinnati's West Side, downtown and the West Side of Covington.

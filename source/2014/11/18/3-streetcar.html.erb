The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) and Cincinnati City Council reached an agreement this week that prohibits any SORTA bus fare money be used to fund streetcar operations. The news is music to Mayor John Cranleyâ€™s ears, who has been opposed to the streetcar from the start. Crawley said it would not be fair to subsidize the streetcar with money taken from the Metro bus service.

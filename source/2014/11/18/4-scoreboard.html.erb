The Bengals’ new scoreboard will cost tax payers $7.5 million dollars as part of the deal the team cut with Hamilton County years ago. The Bengals will cover the remainder of the money required for the $10 million scoreboard. County officials project they have enough estimated revenue to meet the Bengals’ stadium obligations for the next 10 years.

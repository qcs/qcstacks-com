Cincinnati's aging city pension fund continues to be a nuisance for City Planner Milton Dahoney Jr. Moody's recently downgraded the city's general bonds from AA1 to AA2, which translates to the bondâ€™s ratings being labeled "negative." Moody's said the blame for the downgrade primarily rested on the city's lack of a sustainable future for its pension fund. The downgrade in ratings means the city might have more trouble issuing debt in the future.

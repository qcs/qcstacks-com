A memo dated June 20 and released July 15 says Cincinnati received a bad deal on the parking lease agreement with the Greater Cincinnati Port Authority. The research reported in the memo found that it will be 257 percent more expensive for a private contractor to run the city's parking services compare to what the city currently spends. City Manager Milton Dahoney Jr. said the data used to generate the memo was out of date and no longer applies to the current parking lease deal.

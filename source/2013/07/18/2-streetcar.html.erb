The streetcar project is already generating improved real estate sales in Over-the-Rhine. Teach for America announced their plan to move into the Jupiter Building at 1110 Main St. as part of a renewed interest in The Hanke Exchange, a collection of five buildings in OTR between Reading Road and Michael Bany Way. The properties occupancy rate is hovering close to 90 percent, a dramatic increase from 28 percent just three years ago.

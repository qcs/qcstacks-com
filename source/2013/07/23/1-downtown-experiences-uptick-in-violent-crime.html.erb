The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that from Jan. 1 through July 13 violent crime is up 15 percent compared to the same time-period last year. Acting Police Chief Paul Humphries explained the uptick in crime as a response to downtownâ€™s increasing popularity and said most incidents occur after bars close.

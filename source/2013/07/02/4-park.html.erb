Smale Riverfront Park gets more awesome by the day and the National Recreation and Park Association is taking notice. This isn't the first award the city has received for the amazing development happening at the Banks, but it’s the latest for the innovation and creativity exhibited by the Cincinnati Park Board. If you haven’t checked it out yet, grab a picnic lunch and go see what all the buzz is about.

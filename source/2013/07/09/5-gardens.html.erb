The owners of Cincinnati Gardens are currently exploring options to sell the venue. During the past 34 years, the family-operated facility has hosted a slew of hockey teams and more recently housed Xavier Basketball and the Cincinnati Rollergirls. While they hope new ownership will continue the operating tradition of catering to local sports organizations, the Robison family concedes that they may have to consider alternate uses in order to secure a sale.

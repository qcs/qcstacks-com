Glen Galemmo, the owner of Queen City Investment Fund &mdash; completely unrelated to QC Stacks, we promise &mdash; has been accused of operating an elaborate Ponzi scheme believed to cost investors upwards of hundreds of millions of dollars. Most of the 100 Cincinnati investors received an email which read &ldquo;Queen City Investments will no longer be in operation&rdquo; and directed them to local Internal Revenue Service offices to settle their investments.

The Hamilton County Tax Levy Review Committee has recommended that the successful prostitute rehabilitation program Off the Streets be shuttered to save $64,000 from the Family Services and Treatment Levy. Off the Streets success has been well documented, with 84 percent of participants never having another prostitution conviction. Committee members suggested the money instead go toward The Talbert House, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program in Cincinnati.

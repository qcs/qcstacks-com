As if the lengthy wait wasn’t notice enough, Senate’s gourmet all-beef dogs have just been named some of the nation’s best by Food and Wine Magazine. While the dog of the day always ranks amongst the most interesting fare, the Croque Madame and Lindsay Lohan are noted as menu staples. Better get in there soon... something tells me the wait times are about to get a whole lot longer.

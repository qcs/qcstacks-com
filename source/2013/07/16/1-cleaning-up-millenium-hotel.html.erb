Try as they might, Cincinnati public officials just can’t get the aging Millennium Hotel to clean itself up. The Enquirer reports the City has been trying for at least six months to overhaul the hotel. City leaders say that because the Millennium is the only hotel directly connected to the Duke Energy Convention Center it can either make or break a visitor’s view on the city.

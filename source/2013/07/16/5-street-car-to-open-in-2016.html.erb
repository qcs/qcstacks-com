After years of controversy including two failed ballot initiatives to cancel the project, the City announced the Cincinnati streetcar is set to open Sept. 15, 2016. An additional $500,000 was requested by the contractor, which was easily covered by the Cityâ€™s $10 million contingency fund. The total cost for the project is just above $130 million.

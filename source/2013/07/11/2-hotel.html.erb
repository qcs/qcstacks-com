Frequent patrons and out-of-town-guests of the Horshoe Casino will have a new place to crash after marathon gambling sessions. Plans for a Holiday Inn located four blocks south of the casino at Broadway and Seventh streets are moving forward. The developer hopes to have the hotel opened by January 2015.

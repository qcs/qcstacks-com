Despite an earlier assertion that City Manager Milton Dohoney could apply to keep his position once newly elected Mayor John Cranley took office, news has broken that Dohoney can either resign now or choose to be fired. This wasn't entirely surprising, given the deep divide in opinion between the two men. The decision was reportedly mutual; no word on who Dohoney's interim replacement will be.

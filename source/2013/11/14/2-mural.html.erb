In a major public relations blunder, Covington&rsquo;s Cork &lsquo;N Bottle liquor store painted over a mural by street artists The London Police. The mural, along with several others around the city, was commissioned by Covington&rsquo;s BLDG in August. BLDG was owned by Mike Amann, who passed away Sunday after a battle with cancer. In addition to a public apology, Cork &lsquo;N Bottle will donate $1,000 to the American Cancer Society in Amann&rsquo;s name.

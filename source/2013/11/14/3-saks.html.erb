Despite the city&rsquo;s best efforts, Saks Fifth Avenue is heading north to join rival upscale department store Nordtrom&rsquo;s in Kenwood. The City of Cincinnati&rsquo;s offer to Saks of more than 100,000 square feet in complementary retail space was not enough to keep the retailer as a key anchor in plans for a revitalized retail district along Race Street. The city gave Saks $2.1 million in 1996 and another $6.6 million in 2003 for improvements. The Kenwood store is set to open in 2016.

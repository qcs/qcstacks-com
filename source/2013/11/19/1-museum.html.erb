Cincinnati Museum Center might never have to go back to voters asking for a tax levy if it weren&rsquo;t for the constant repairs its home at Union Terminal requires. Unfortunately those repairs to the aging Union Terminal add up quickly and both the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County often quibble about who is on the hook for paying for the fixes. Hamilton County Commissioners told the Museum Center that they won&rsquo;t approve their request for a $15 million per year tax levy until the repairs at Union Terminal are completed. Hamilton County Commissioner Greg Hartmann said the $180 million needed to fully repair Union Terminal needed to be reduced.

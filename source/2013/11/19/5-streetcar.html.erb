If John Cranley gets his way and ends development on the streetcar, Cincinnati will have to pay back the federal government all of the grant money the project has been given. The project is slated to receive $44.9 million from three separate federal grants, which Cranley had hope to reuse for other projects such as the Western Hills Viaduct.  Fortunately the project has only spent $2 million of federal money.

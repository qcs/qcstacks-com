Thanks to opposition to Cincinnati's responsible bidder ordinance, and some legal ambiguity as to the jurisdiction of city vs. state bidding rules, several Metropolitan Sewer District projects are at a stand-still. According to some Council Members, the only solution to the impasse is to scrap the city ordinance entirely. MSD currently faces a federal mandate to reduce sewer overflow and the disagreement over the bidding process is clogging the tubes.

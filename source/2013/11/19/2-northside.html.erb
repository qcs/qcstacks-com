Bike enthusiasts' wheels must be turning thanks to a new proposed bikeway connecting Northside to Downtown. With all the neighborhoods in between also benefitting, the project will convert one lane of Central Parkway, running in either direction for bike-only use. The funds for the work come courtesy of a state grant; work will start in the summer of 2014.

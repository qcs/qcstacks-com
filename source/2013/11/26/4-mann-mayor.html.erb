Should John Cranley get hit by a bus &mdash; his words, not ours &mdash; Councilman-elect David Mann will be the city&rsquo;s next mayor. Cranley announced recently that the 74-year-old Mann will be Cincinnati&rsquo;s next vice-mayor. Mann has a storied career in local Cincinnati politics having served on council from 1974&ndash;1992 and was mayor from 1980&ndash;1982.

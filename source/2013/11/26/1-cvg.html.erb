Small surprise: Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has lost more flights than any other major U.S. airport while having some of the nation&rsquo;s fastest-climbing fares. The study, conducted by USA Today, analyzed changes in flights, seats and fares from 2005 - 2013. During that time, CVG lost 78 percent of flights. The same time period saw average fares increase 26 percent.

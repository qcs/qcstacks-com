In a move which will more than double its capacity and continue the rapid gentrification of OTR, the Drop Inn Center and downtown developer darling 3CDC have reached an agreement to move the largest homeless shelter to Queensgate. Barring some zoning restrictions, if the deal proceeds as planned, construction on the new site could begin as early as the second quarter of next year.

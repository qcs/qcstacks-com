In other Cranley news, Cincinnati neighborhoods may soon feel the sweet financial windfall of some new mayoral priorities. Chief among them, the bike trail on Wasson Way, a new interchange at I-71 &amp; MLK, and putting an end to the one-trash-can policy recently imposed on city residents. And not to be forgotten, OTR and the central business district downtown could see some changes to the controversial parking-lease plan as Cranley intends to cancel that too. Yep, our new mayor's got quite the laundry-list of stuff for his first term in office.

Is 3CDC looking for someone to make small-batch, artisanal Twinkies? Probably not, but the development corporation known for being a key player in the Over-the-Rhine transformation recently purchased the former Butternut bread factory from Hostess. 3CDC has been mum on their plans for the factory, but it could be related to their Queensgate plans, which include a new City Gospel Mission building in the area.

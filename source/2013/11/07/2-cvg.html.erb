If you always thought CVG&rsquo;s airfare rates were higher than those elsewhere in the region you might be right. CVG&rsquo;s average domestic fare tops out at $518.09, which is the second-highest in the nation. The average national rate is close to $375. Despite being one of the most expensive places to depart from, CVG&rsquo;s rates are down 15.5% from 2000.

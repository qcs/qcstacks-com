A lawsuit filed against Miami University is raising eyebrows about how universities should be held accountable for sexual assaults that happen on or near campus. A female Miami University student is charging the school with negligence after being raped in 2011. She says there were several red flags attributed to her attacker such as multiple instances reported by the Oxford police of “lewd sexual behavior” that should have resulted in his expulsion. This isn’t the first time the so-called Public Ivy university has come under fire for not portraying an environment of sexual safety. In 2012 a flier titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape” was circulated in MU’s freshman dorms, which resulted in the university being criticized for not publicizing the incident properly.

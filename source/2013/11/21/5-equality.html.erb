Cincinnati's standing within the LGBT community has improved over the last year according it's score on the Municipal Equality Index, a measure compiled and released by the Human Rights Campaign. The score, which reflects the city's support of LGBT citizens who live and work here, was computed for municipalities across the country. Cincinnati scored 90 out of a possible 100, with the only impediment to a perfect score being lack of a domestic partner registry that supports LGBT relationships.

Much to the chagrin of Ohio prosecutors and police chiefs, Ohioans might soon be able to use deadly force in public as an act of self defense. Commonly referred to as “stand your ground laws,” a House committee approved gun legislation that recognizes concealed-carry licenses in other states and extended the use of deadly force outside of a person’s home or vehicle if acting in self-defense. The law is expected to go to the entire House for debate soon.

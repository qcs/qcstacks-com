Ever wonder what&rsquo;s left inside the old Shillito&rsquo;s building? So did the Cincinnati Business Courier. The publications&rsquo; offices sit on the bottom floor of the former department store and has the Landor branding agency as its neighbors. Landor recently hosted a &ldquo;Shillito&rsquo;s Abandoned&rdquo; benefit in support of Covington&rsquo;s Mike Amman, the owner of BLDG who is battling cancer. Check out for some spooky photos from the abandoned department store.

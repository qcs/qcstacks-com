Based on an analysis done by a former Procter &amp; Gamble Co. executive, the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority could receive more than $230 million during the next 40 years as a result of its deal to lease Cincinnatiâ€™s parking assets. The City of Cincinnati estimates to see an up-front $85-million payment plus an additional yearly amount ranging between $3 million and $19 million until 2053. The executive who completed the analysis, said he believes the city could have generated an additional $80 million if they kept the parking system and made the technological improvements themselves.

Shin-soo Choo rejected a one-year $14.1 million qualifying offer to stay with the Cincinnati Reds for one more season. Choo instead will test how much he can make on the free market from other teams, which according to Choo&rsquo;s agent, Scott Boras, could top out at $126 million for seven years. The Reds&rsquo; center fielder had a .285 batting average with 54 RBIs in 2013.

Contractors responsible for the ongoing construction work related to the contested streetcar are weighing a plan to work 24 hours a day on the project in effort to hasten any disruptions as the project crosses Liberty. While some may view this move with abject skepticism, officials managing the project have clarified that the plan has nothing to do with very public political opposition waged by incoming Mayor John Cranley during his campaign.

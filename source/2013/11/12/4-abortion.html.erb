Cincinnati could soon be left without an abortion clinic due to restrictions passed in this summer&rsquo;s state budget. If that happens, Cincinnati would be the largest metropolitan area in the country without an abortion clinic, according to an analysis by The Cincinnati Enquirer. The restrictions stem from a rule that disallows abortion clinics to agree to a patient-transfer agreement with a taxpayer-funded hospital, which is forcing the clinics to find private hospitals for such agreements. Many private-funded hospitals are either religiously backed or won&rsquo;t enter agreements with abortion clinics.

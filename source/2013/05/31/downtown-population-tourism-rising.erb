A newly released report by Downtown Cincinnati Inc. show neighborhoods of Pendleton, Over the Rhine and the Central Business District have continued to experience population and tourism growth during 2012. While the most recent gains are modest, growth is expected to continue due to more than $100 million dollars in residential projects currently under development.

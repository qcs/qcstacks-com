A trolley and a streetcar in Cincinnati? It could be a possibility if Hop on Cincinnati leaders get their way. The group is proposing a $10 &ndash; $15 million trackless trolley that runs from Downtown to Mt. Adams. Funding would come from some federal transportation funds, local governments and corporate sponsors, the group said. The initial plan would be similar to the Southbank Shuttle trolley in Northern Kentucky and would have 20 stops.

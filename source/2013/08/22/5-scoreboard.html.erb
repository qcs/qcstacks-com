Not to be outdone by other NFL stadiums, the Bengals think time is getting close for an upgrade to their scoreboard. Conditions with the team&rsquo;s lease with Hamilton County call for the Bengals to get a new $10-million high-definition scoreboard installed when at least 14 other NFL teams have similar technology. Hopefully the Bengals don&rsquo;t ask for the scoreboard any time soon, Board of Commissioners President Chris Monzel said the county can&rsquo;t currently afford the $10-million price tag.

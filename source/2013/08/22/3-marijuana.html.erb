A Kentucky House and Senate Committee on Health and Welfare was the scene Wednesday of a raucous hearing on medical marijuana with advocates proposing a state law to allow the substance to be used for medical purposes. Supporters of the the measure say it&rsquo;s less addicting than prescription painkillers such as Oxycodone. Despite skepticism of the proposed law, Sen. Perry Clark, a Louisville Democrat, plans to file the measure in 2014.

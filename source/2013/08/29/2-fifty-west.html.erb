Mark your calendars folks: local brewery Fifty West Brewing is hosting a free suds and music festival for all ages September 7th. In addition to its own fine line of craft beers and food, you can expect offerings from at least five other local breweries at Fifty Fest. Add to that eight local bands and you have a bonafide, family-friendly shindig.

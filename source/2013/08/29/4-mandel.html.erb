Republican Ohio treasurer Josh Mandel could be in violation of federal campaign finance law after failing to report two traffic accidents since becoming treasurer in 2011. Mandel was riding in a vehicle that was paid for by his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign against Sherrod Brown that was involved in a late-night accident in March of this year. Federal law states Senate campaign property cannot be used for personal use and can only be used for transportation during the campaign. The accident occurred four months after Mandel lost the Senate race.

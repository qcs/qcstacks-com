Rain or shine, Cincinnati&rsquo;s and Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s Riverfest will do its best to light up the skies above the Ohio River this Sunday evening. If you plan on attending by water be sure to grab your spot early as boaters arrive days before the event. A number of roads, bridges and exits off 71 will be closed for the event including the Clay Wade Bailey Bridge, Suspension Bridge, Purple People Bridge and Taylor Southgate Bridge.

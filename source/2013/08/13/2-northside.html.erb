Cincinnati City Council approved a $10.5 million project to be built on the corner of Hamilton Avenue and Blue Rock Street in Northside, which would include 104 apartments and 8,000 square feet of commercial space. Construction at location, which was once home to the former Mergard&rsquo;s Bowling Alley, is set to begin this fall or early 2014.

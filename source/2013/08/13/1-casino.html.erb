A blunder at Cincinnati&rsquo;s Horseshoe Casino Sunday ended up costing the casino $1 million. Due to a name mix up, the casino awarded a $1 million prize to the incorrect Kevin Lewis before realizing their mistake. To their credit the casino also awarded the correct winner $1 million and allowed their mistake to make the incorrect Lewis $1 million happier. The prize was a promotion for the casino&rsquo;s Total Rewards program.

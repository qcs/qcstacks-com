The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy profile of Steve Leeper, the man who is transforming downtown one neighborhood at a time. The city brought Leeperto the Queen City from Pittsburgh nearly a decade ago to remake the city&rsquo;s urban core. Leeper&rsquo;s tenure as the head of 3CDC hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy, however. Critics claim some of his policies have displaced affordable housing and have neglected historic buildings. Leeper maintains that without 3CDC&rsquo;s efforts the buildings would have fallen into disrepair. Leeper says 3CDC&rsquo;s plans for the next five years include turning close to 100 vacant buildings into offices, apartments, condos and stores in Over-the-Rhine.

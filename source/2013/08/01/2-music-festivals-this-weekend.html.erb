If Lumenocity isn’t your thing, other music festivals are all over town this weekend too. In its 21st year, Bluefest returns to  Sawyer Point Friday and Saturday. And starting tonight in Eden park , you can catch the 28th year of It’s Commonly Jazz, a free event that will take place every Thursday in August.

Thanks to an innocuous paperwork error, one incumbent candidate for Cincinnati City Council may be left off the ballot this fall.

Sittenfeld is appealing to his constituents for some fast signatures after campaign workers changed some incorrect dates on petitions. The haphazard edits may serve to invalidate all of his progress thus far.

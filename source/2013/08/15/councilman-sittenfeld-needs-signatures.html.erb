As they say, the devil is in the details and thanks to an innocuous paperwork error, one incumbent candidate for Cincinnati City Council may fall victim. With just one week left to meet his filing deadline for inclusion on the November ballot, Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld is appealing to his constituents for some fast signatures after campaign workers changed some incorrect dates on petitions. The haphazard edits may serve to invalidate all of his progress thus far.

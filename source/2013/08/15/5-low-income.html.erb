While the developers working in OTR have made some significant strides in revitalizing the ailing downtown community, there has thus far been a large ratio between low-income and market-rate housing options. Cincinnati City Council hopes to change that disparity by allocating funds and tax breaks for low-income developments. The most recent benefactor is a 13-unit apartment building on the 1400 block of Republic Street, just down the street from Washington Park.

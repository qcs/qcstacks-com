The Requiem Project sued the University of Cincinnati and two corporations Monday with allegations that the university and its partners blocked the nonprofit&rsquo;s renovation efforts. The lawsuit comes on the heels of The Requiem Project being forced to evacuate the historic theater Aug. 3 after its agreement to manage the 102-year-old theater was not renewed earlier this year. The Requiem Project hopes to secure a long-term lease  so that it can finish the renovations which are estimated to cost between $3 to $5 million.

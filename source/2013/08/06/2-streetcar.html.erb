Despite their many similarities, Cincinnati&rsquo;s two Democratic mayoral candidates have two striking differences: their views on the streetcar and whether or not privatizing the city&rsquo;s parking services was a wise decision. Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls is very much pro-streetcar, while former city council member John Cranley is vocally against the streetcar. Cranley thinks the privatization of the city&rsquo;s parking services was a bad deal, but Qualls thought it was the only way to avoid police and fire layoffs. Their stances on each issue could be the deciding factor of who is elected the city&rsquo;s next mayor. The last time the two candidates were on the ballot together, they nearly matched one another's vote count: 33,775 for Qualls and 33,772 for Cranley.

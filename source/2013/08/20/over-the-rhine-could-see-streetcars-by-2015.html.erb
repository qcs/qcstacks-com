Cincinnati could see streetcars running through Over-the-Rhine sooner than the original Sept. 15, 2016 launch date. According to John Deatrick, the leader of the project, cars could be running on the O.T.R loop by late 2015. The downtown loop will still be under construction up until the previously announced date.

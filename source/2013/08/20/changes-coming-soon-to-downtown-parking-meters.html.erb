The Cincinnati Reds and neighborhood community councils have forced changes to Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authorityâ€™s plans for parking meters. A number of changes were recently announced, including meters in downtown and Over-the-Rhine to expand enforcement hours to 9 p.m. and extending the max amount of hours per meter to four hours instead of two.

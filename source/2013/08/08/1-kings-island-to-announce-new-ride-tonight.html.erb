A new “record-breaking” attraction at King’s Island is expected to be announced tonight at 10 p.m., according to The Enquirer. The ride is to be located in the park’s north end where the now-demolished Son of Beast once stood. The designer of the new ride also designed the amusement park’s popular The Beast roller coaster.

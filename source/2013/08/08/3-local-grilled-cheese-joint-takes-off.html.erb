Cincinnati’s Tom+Chee could soon be expanding to cities as far away as Portland. After a May appearance on ABC’s “Shark Tank,” the mom-and-pop grilled cheese and soup joint has taken more than 7,000 franchisee requests. The restaurant just signed a location in New Jersey and is expected to announce others in Michigan and Atlanta.

The century-old building that used to house Clifton restaurant  Lendhardt’s does not meet the criteria for historic designation, according to a Cincinnati council committee. The decision which opens the doors for a sale by the restaurant’s owners, could spell certain doom for the building as interested developers make plans to demolish the structure. Opponents of the sale are not happy.

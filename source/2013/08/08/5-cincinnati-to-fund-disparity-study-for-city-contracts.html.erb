Minority and women-owned businesses might soon find an uptick in contracts awarded to them from the city of Cincinnati. City Council unanimously passed a motion to use funds from the parking lease deal to fund a disparity study that would examine whether or not the city should change its contracting policies to award more contracts to minority and women-owned businesses, according to CityBeat. The cost to complete the study is estimated between $500,000 and $1.5 million.

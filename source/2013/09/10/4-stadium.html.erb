Hamilton County voters might be out of their tax rebate they were promised when they voted to approve the two riverfront stadiums in 1996. According to a 2019 stadium fund plan, decreased sales taxes contributed to the stadium fund rebate being reduced from the original 30 percent tax rollback approved by voters. The tax rollback could be further reduced or entirely eliminated if the Bengals request a new scoreboard by 2019.

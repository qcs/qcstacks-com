Cincinnatians looking for a job might want to focus their search on information technology as the Business Courier reports as many as 10,000 unfilled Cincinnati-area jobs could be available as soon as 2020. By contrast, there are only 1,800 students enrolled in IT-related degrees in universities across town. The Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber is currently working with schools and students in grades K-12 to increase interest and awareness in information technology.

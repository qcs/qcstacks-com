Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble joined other Fortune 500 companies last week when it sponsored legislation ending workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There is no law currently on the books that penalizes or limits a workplace from refusing to hire or firing someone based on their sexuality. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act has strong bipartisan support and is supported by many small businesses.

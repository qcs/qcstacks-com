Mayoral candidate John Cranley has now outraised his primary opponent Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls by more than $150,000. The former councilman has said he plans to raise at least $1 million by election day and his latest numbers suggest that goal is within reach, having already raised over $561,000 in total.

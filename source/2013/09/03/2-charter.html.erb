The city&rsquo;s impending pension crisis comes to a head today, as City Council will take up a vote on whether to place a pension-alerting charter amendment on the ballot this fall. Previously opposed by a large majority of the council, the ballot initiative comes by way more than 8,000 petition signatures collected by the Cincinnati for Pension Reform Committee. The group proposes replacing the current pension system with 401k-style retirement accounts for all new employees after the end of the year.

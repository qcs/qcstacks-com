Lunken Airport missed out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in improvements due to poor management and technology problems, according to an audit by the city&rsquo;s Citizen Complaint and Internal Audit department. Among the findings, the city failed to collect landing fees that totaled $120,000 and is owed $420,000 for six years of back rent from the Metropolitan Sewer Department. Despite the losses, Lunken remains in the black and generated $2.1 million in revenue last year.

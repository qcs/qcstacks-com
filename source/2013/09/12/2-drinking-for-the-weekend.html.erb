Cold beverage enthusiasts will have something fun to do this weekend as Cincy Beerfest returns to Fountain Park. Boasting hundreds of craft beers, including some hard-to-find, rare specialties, the craft-beer consortium runs from 6 to 11pm Friday and Saturday evenings. Tickets are available at the door or in advance.

Cold beverage enthusiasts will have something fun to do this weekend as the Cincy Beerfest returns to Fountain Park. Boasting hundreds of craft beers, including some hard-to-find, rare specialties, the fest runs from 6 to 11pm Friday and Saturday evenings. Tickets are available at the door or in advance.

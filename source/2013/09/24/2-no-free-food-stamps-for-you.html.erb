Governor Kasich’s decision to not renew a waiver aimed at relaxing requirements on food stamps recipients in the state will affect over 130,000 people, more than 18,000 of which live in Hamilton County. The administration contends that thanks to Ohio’s recent economic recovery, the waiver is not necessary and all able-bodied adults without children should get back to work.

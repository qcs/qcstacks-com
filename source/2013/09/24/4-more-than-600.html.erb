More than 600,000 revelers turned out for this year’s Oktoberfest Zinzinnati, which for the first time opened its beer booths and schnitzel smorgasbords Friday evening. The crowd on Saturday was the largest single-day crowd in the event’s 38-year history. Cincinnati’s festive event is the largest Oktoberfest outside of the original home in Munich, Germany.

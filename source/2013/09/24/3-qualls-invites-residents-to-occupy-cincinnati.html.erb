Cincinnati mayoral-candidate Roxanne Qualls and community partners unveiled their “Come Home Cincinnati” initiative, which is aimed at decreasing vacancy of dilapidated buildings and redevelop blighted neighborhoods. Owner-occupants of the empty buildings have to meet minimum credit requirements, promise to live in the properties for at least five years, and finance 5 percent of the total rehab costs as down payment. In exchange, the loan on the property will be refinanced with the same or better interest rates within five years. The initiative will start with 100 properties in Walnut Hills and Evanston with plans to extend into Avondale, College Hill, Madisonville and other neighborhoods as program funds grow.

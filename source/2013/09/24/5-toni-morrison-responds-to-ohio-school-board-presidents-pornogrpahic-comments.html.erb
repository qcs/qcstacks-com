Toni Morrison responded to Ohio School Board President Debe Tehar’s comments calling the author’s novel The Bluest Eye “pornographic” by calling the president’s statements ironic considering Morrison herself is from Ohio. Tehar suggested any mention of the novel be dropped from Ohio’s new Common Core education standards because its storyline follows a young girl from Lorain, Ohio whose father rapes and impregnates her. The American Civil Liberties Union responded by writing a scolding letter to Tehar.

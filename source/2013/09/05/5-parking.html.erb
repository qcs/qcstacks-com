Persistent opponents of the city&rsquo;s recent decision to lease its parking assets is making more legal waves this week, albeit with not much success. The Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) was denied an appeal yesterday by the Ohio Supreme Court for its first judicial effort in the matter. And this morning, COAST argues before Hamilton County Common Pleas that the current version of the lease has changed enough to warrant another vote. If found to be true, the ruling could jeopardize the entire plan as a majority of council members have since changed their tunes.

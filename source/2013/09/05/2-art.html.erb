Last year Cincinnati City Council banned advertisements on public bus shelters, which prompted many people to think the shelters were abandoned. ArtWorks saw this as an opportunity and will begin the process of converting the old advertising spaces to canvases for local artists. Ryan Little, the lead artist for ArtWorks, and apprentices aged 14-to-21 will design the art that will be placed on the shelters.

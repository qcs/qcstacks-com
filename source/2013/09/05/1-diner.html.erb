This Saturday marks the second D&icirc;ner en Blanc Cincinnati where all participants are required to dress head to toe in white. The picnic party event started in Paris 25 years ago and currently takes place in 40 cities worldwide. Participants are required to bring their own food, tables, linens and chairs to the pop-up event, which has 1,750 people registered and more than 500 on the waitlist. Attendees are told the location of the event just hours beforehand. Last year&rsquo;s D&icirc;ner en Blanc took place at Lytle Park.

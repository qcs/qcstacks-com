Following weeks of well-intentioned efforts by the city to lure more jobs downtown, only to be curtly undermined by Governor Kasich&rsquo;s office and subsequent threats to take its business across the river, Pure Romance has officially committed to Cincinnati. The move will indeed bring more than 100 jobs downtown and will likely occupy the Delta Airlines building on Plum street.

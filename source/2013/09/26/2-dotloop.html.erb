Cincinnati-based startup Dotloop has been hit with a lawsuit for copyright infringement and a cease-and-desist letter for using a Realtor&rsquo;s association&rsquo;s forms in its software. Dotloop, which started in 2008 as MLS Contracts, is being sued by LoopNet, an online real estate marketplace, who maintains Dotloop&rsquo;s CEO Austin Allison was well aware of the name dispute as Allison was a registered member of LoopNet. Allison and partners filed for the Dotloop trademark in 2011. The company faces another legal battle from the California Association of Realtors who claim Dotloop steals and alters their real estate forms.

Cincinnati-based startup Dotloop has been hit with a lawsuit for copyright infringement and a cease-and-desist letter for using a Realtor&rsquo;s association&rsquo;s forms in its software. Dotloop, which was started in 2008 and named MLS Contracts, is being sued by LoopNet, an online real estate marketplace, maintains Dotloop&rsquo;s CEO Austin Allison was well aware of the name dispute since Allison was a registered member of LoopNet. The company filed for the Dotloop trademark in 2011. The company faces another legal battle from the California Association of Realtors who claim Dotloop steals and alters their real estate forms.

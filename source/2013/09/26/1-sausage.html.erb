Chinese investors are one step closer to acquiring Smithfield Foods, the parent company of John Morrell, a nationwide pork production company headquartered in Cincinnati. Following shareholders approval of the sale for over 4 billion dollars, Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. will pay $34 per share in the deal, more than 30 percent more than the current market value.

This past Tuesday, City councilman Chris Seelbach got to experience first-hand the problem of gun violence in Queen City. As he and his partner were at home watching TV about 10:30 pm, they heard gunshots outside their window. Upon investigation, they discovered a victim, bleeding profusely and struggling to cross the street. Thanks to the councilman’s quick response, emergency personnel whisked the man away to hospital where he’s expected to recover.

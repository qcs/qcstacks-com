There&rsquo;s a new sheriff in town. Or at least there will be as soon as City Manager Milton Dohoney announced last week that Jeffery Blackwell, the current deputy chief of the Columbus Police Department, was selected to replace former Police Chief James Craig. Craig left the Cincinnati Police Department for the top police job in Detroit last June. Blackwell has been on the force for 26 years and was picked over three other finalists.

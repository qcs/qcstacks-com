Cincinnati City Council unanimously rejected the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stand Your Ground&rdquo; laws in a vote last Wednesday. The restrictions on gun laws were introduced June 11 by two House Republicans and are aimed to loosen restrictions on the use of deadly force when a person has no option to retreat in a dangerous situation. Councilmembers insisted that Ohio already has strong enough laws to protect those who face physical harm from others. The bill would also loosen restrictions on concealed carry permits.

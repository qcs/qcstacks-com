Cincinnati could soon be home to 21 bike share locations thanks to a partnership between two private organizations and city government. The newly formed program - Cincy Bike Share, Inc. - hopes to be running by 2014 and is looking for its first executive director. Program leaders hope to cover the $1.2 million in start-up costs through private donations and hope that the remaining $450,000 operating costs will come through user fees, sponsorships and memberships.

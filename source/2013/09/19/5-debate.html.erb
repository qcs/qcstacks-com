John Cranley and Roxanne Qualls squared off in their first post-primary mayoral debate Tuesday, which featured both candidates disagreeing sharply on both the streetcar project and the city&rsquo;s parking lease deal. Cranley maintains the city promotes controversial and risky moves such as the streetcar at the expense of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods in favor of downtown. Qualls says Cincinnati&rsquo;s investment in its core is central to bringing growth to downtown and the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods. Cranley is fiercely opposed to the streetcar project and in favor of a trackless trolley system instead.

Hamilton County Juvenile Court Judge Tracy Hunter has four weeks to act on six outstanding cases or will be cited for contempt by an appeals court. According to Hamilton County Public Defender Ray Faller, Hunter&rsquo;s failure to act on cases was preventing children from being adopted, getting out of juvenile jail and delays in finding long-term foster care for children. The possible punishment for contempt is 30 days in jail and/or a $250 fine per case.

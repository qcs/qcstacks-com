Now where are we going to shop? Hoity-toity downtown residents might soon be out of luck if the owners of the embattled Kenwood Collection get their way by luring luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue out of downtown. The long-stalled Kenwood project is looking to attract upscale retailers such as Saks to anchor its reboot. Since 1996 the city of Cincinnati has given Saks a total of $8.7 million for renovations to keep the retailer downtown.

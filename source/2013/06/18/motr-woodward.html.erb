Got plans tonight? If you're into historical building renovation and enjoy a good theatre facade, stop by MOTR on Main street tonight at 7pm to celebrate the 100th birthday of the Woodward Theatre. The new owners will unveil their future plans for the venue and commemorate the event with an official lighting of the facade at sunset. Afterwards, it's drinks and music at MOTR with the multi-talented Brian Olive.

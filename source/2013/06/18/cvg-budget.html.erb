Tired of losing fliers to Columbus, Louisville and Dayton, CVG is trying to lure more low-cost carriers to 8 popular cities with local travelers. Frontier Airlines &mdash; CVG's first low-cost airline since the 1990s &mdash; has a daily non-stop flight to Denver. CVG is trying to land JetBlue and Southwest airlines to join it's budget-friendly fleet, but so far the airlines are waiting to see how Frontier's business fares before making any firm commitments.

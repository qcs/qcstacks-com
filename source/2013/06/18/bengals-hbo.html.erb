Following a confusing couple of tweets early this week, news from CincyJungle indicates that the Bengals will indeed reprise their role in HBO's Hard Knocks series this summer. A reality TV series with seven seasons under it's belt, Hard Knocks offers a glimpse of the NFL and its players from the sidelines. The Bengals were last featured on the show in 2009.

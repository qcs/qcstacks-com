As the on-going struggle to resolve the national health-care crisis continues, a majority of Ohioans have reported support for an expansion of Medicaid in the state. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, states are now obligated to comply with the expansion to the tune of 10 percent of the cost after the first three years. Conservative state legislators have signaled some concern over the long-term viability of federal support and have thus far been reluctant to embrace the expansion.

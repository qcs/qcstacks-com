Do you often find yourself short of ammo after firing 31 rounds from a semi-automatic weapon? If so, you might be in luck. State Rep. John Becker of Union Township introduced a bill in the Ohio House that changes the definition of semi-automatic firearms to no longer qualify them as automatic firearms, therefore skirting the law of a magazine holding a maximum of 31 rounds of ammunition. Proponents of the bill say stopping to reload after 31 shots takes too much time. To put things in perspective: Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter, had several 30-round magazines.

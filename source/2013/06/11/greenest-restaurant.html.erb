It might not be the first place you think of when you need a bite to eat, but The Cincinnati Zoo's new Base Camp Cafe was just named the Greenest Restaurant in the country. Food is served in compostable containers and the restaurant is trying to increase its menu's ingredients to contain more locally grown produce.

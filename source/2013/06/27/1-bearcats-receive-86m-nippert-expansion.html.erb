The Bearcats may have a new home for their 2014 football season: Paul Brown Stadium. The team is in talks with the Cincinnati Bengals to temporarily use their field while an $86 million expansion is performed to Nippert Stadium starting immediately after the Bearcatsâ€™ 2013 season. The expansion will include a new pavillion with club seats, expanded restrooms and concessions and a skywalk to Tangeman University Center.

Building by building, Over the Rhine is slowly inching back to its brewing roots. Rhinegeist Brewing joins Christian Moerlein as yet another microbrewery in Cincinnati when it opens its doors to the public this Saturday, June 29. Rhinegeist will have four beers on tap at its opening and will primarily focus on West Coast-style beers that play up citrusy, hoppy and tropical flavors. The brewery plans to start canning 16-ounce beers in the fall, but in the meantime visitors can pick up 32- or 64-ounce growlers.

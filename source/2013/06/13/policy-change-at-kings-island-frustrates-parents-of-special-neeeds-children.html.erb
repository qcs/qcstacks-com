Autistic children may be waiting longer to board the amusement rides at King's Island this summer, thanks to a policy change at the park. Much to the chagrin of their parents, these special needs kids will now be required to request a boarding time equal to the ride's anticipated wait. This comes in contrast to previous years when these riders were allowed to board after just a short period of time. Parents are pissed.

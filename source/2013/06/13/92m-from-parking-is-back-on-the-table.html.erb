Despite the majority of City Council disapproving and more than 12,000 signatures of voters seeking a referendum this November, an appeals court ruling Wednesday allows the city to move forward with it's plan to lease its parking system to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority. Some of the money will go toward the 30-story apartment building and grocery where Pogue's garage now stands. Additional money will go toward city infrastructure projects, including building a new interchange at 71 and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.

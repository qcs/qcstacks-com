This July, Four Entertainment Group (4EG) will add a new concept bar in Clifton to its ever-growing list of hipster hangouts. Named after the Major General  of the American Revolution who named Cincinnati, St. Claire will be well-stocked with craft beer, flat screen TVs and even feature live DJs on the weekends. Anyone up for happy-hour?

Hamilton County Commissioner Chris Monzel and Councilman Chris Seelbach announced a deal today that should lift a hold on county funds dedicated to fixing the city's aging sewer system. As a condition, city council will rework the "responsible bidder" legislation passed last month that requires contractors to establish and fund accredited apprenticeship programs.

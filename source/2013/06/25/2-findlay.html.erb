Findlay Market is expanding into Price Hill starting July 2 at Robert’s Academy in an effort to bring fresh fruit and vegetables grown from urban gardens in Over the Rhine. The weekly market will be open Tuesday from 2 &ndash; 6 p.m. There has also been talk about expanding Findlay’s urban gardening initiatives to the site of the former St. Aloysius Orphanage in Bond Hill.

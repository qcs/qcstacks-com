Last week, the controversy surrounding the cityâ€™s decision to lease parking meters to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority was officially put to rest. On Monday, City Manager Milton Dohoney signed the lease and on Friday, chairman of the Port Authority board Otto Budig did the same. The result is no less than 30 years of managed parking assets for the city, netting $92 million upfront and at least $3 million annually moving forward.

If you’re looking for a place to recommend to friends to crash when they visit town, Ghettopia might be your answer. Susan Angel wants to bring some of Europe’s bunkhouse mentality to Over the Rhine by opening Ghettopia OTR Bunk Haus, a 22-room hostel complete with three showers, steam room and a kitchenette. Beds at Ghettopia are $25 per night, $120 per week and $420 per month.

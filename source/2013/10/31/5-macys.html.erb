A security guard for Cincinnati based retailer Macy's is claiming that she was subject to weekly arrest quotas and routinely targeted minorities in one of their Manhattan locations. The allegations are the subject of a lawsuit which may be given class-action status soon, and follows similar lawsuits presented against other New York retail outfits.

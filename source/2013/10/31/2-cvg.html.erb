Despite a recommendation from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport's oversight board to revamp travel policies and expenses for board members, airport chairman and vice chairman are currently on a trip to Italy totaling at least $20,000, according to the Enquirer. The six-month-old recommendation said CVG's travel policies were not in line with other airports around the country. The airport board is setup as a public agency and is considered a governmental agency. In addition to the Italy trip, The Enquirer has a lengthy list of documents detailing other spending habits of the board on its website.

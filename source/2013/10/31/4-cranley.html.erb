When human resources and payroll company Paycor was looking to make the move from Cincinnati to Norwood in 2012, Cincinnati-Mayoral Candidate John Cranley was there to help finalize the deal. Cranley was working as a lobbyist for Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, the law firm who helped Paycor gain tax incentives to relocate to Norwood. Cranley's campaign manager said the candidate was simply doing his job at the time and was only doing what his client asked. Three weeks after the Norwood City Council approved Paycor's move on Oct. 23, 2013, Cranley announced his candidacy for mayor.

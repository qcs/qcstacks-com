In his final State of City speech, Mayor Mark Mallory capped off his second term with a proposal to build a new bridge to Kentucky from the West Side. As part of that effort, he threw out a lot of related ideas, including community farming, easy access to CVG and an entertainment zone that would allow residents to watch movies against a waterfall. The Cincinnati Business Courier has video of the speech.

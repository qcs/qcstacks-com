Another day, another lawsuit from COAST (Citizens Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes) at the ironic expense more of taxpayer dollars. This time the ultra-conservative group takes aim at Councilman Chris Seelbach, alleging improper use of campaign funds on a recent trip to the nation's capital. Rather than engage in lengthy litigation, the Councilman has agreed to write a personal check for approximately $1,200 to have the suit dismissed. City Solicitor John Curp has responded in a 5-page rebuttal saying the allegations are entirely without merit.

Recent political rhetoric surrounding the dismantling of Cincinnati's Streetcar ignores the financial realities, according to CityBeat. Former Councilman John Cranley, who's opposition to the project has been a cornerstone of his mayoral campaign remains steadfast in his intention to halt progress already underway, despite more than $117 million dollars already spent or obligated to the effort.

Parent company of Lenscrafters and Mason-headquartered eye-wear manufacturer Luxottica plans to invest $250 million into its operations between now and 2016. While that money will be spread throughout its North American operations, the mayor of Mason is confident the move will bring positive financial impact to his community. The investment is part of a strategy by company executives to grow their business by billions over the next few years.

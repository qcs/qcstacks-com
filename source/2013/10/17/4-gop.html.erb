Cincinnati Republicans Steve Chabot and Brad Wenstrup both voted to allow the Federal Government to default on its debt Wednesday, which would have caused financial shockwaves throughout the economy. Both Congressmen bucked fellow Ohioan House Speaker John Boehner who voted to raise the debt limit. Thankfully level-headedness and common sense prevailed when President Obama and Congress ended the 16-day government shutdown by passing legislation to raise the country&rsquo;s debt ceiling late Wednesday night.

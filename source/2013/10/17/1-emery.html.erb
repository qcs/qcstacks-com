The embattled legal battle to wrestle control of the Emery Building from the University of Cincinnati by The Requiem Project continues to play out in court. The Requiem Project filed an amendment to its lawsuit against UC arguing that the university has failed its obligation to keep the theater from falling into disrepair. The Requiem&rsquo;s co-founders claim UC is prohibiting their ability to renovate the theater and turn it into 1,600-seat &ldquo;acoustically pure&rdquo; theater.

The plan for what to do with Tower Place is moving forward with developers hoping to start construction before the end of the year. Assuming sale of the property closes as expected, the aging building on the corner of 4th and Race will be transformed into a multi-level parking facility with street level retail space. Retailers have already expressed some interest in the opportunity.

Who knew things could get so heated at a nail salon? According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, Chanh Luong, owner of the Escape Nail Spa in Hyde Park, was threatened and then beaten by his competitor John Nguyen who owns the Ambiance spa group. The incident occurred April 1 when Nguyen entered Escape Nail Spa and threatened Luong to remove a promotion or else. Within moments of refusing Nguyen and three of his employees punched Luong, broke a chair and swept bottles and equipment from a counter inside Escape. Nguyen was thrown in jail for 10 days and paid Luong&rsquo;s $8,000 hospital bill.

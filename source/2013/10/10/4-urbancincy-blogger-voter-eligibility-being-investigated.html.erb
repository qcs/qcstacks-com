In an interesting thread during this year's election cycle, The Hamilton County Board of Elections commenced a hearing this week on the voter eligibility of Randy Simes, a local blogger who submitted an absentee ballot for the upcoming mayoral race. According to the complaint filed by the Ohio Voter Integrity Project, Simes who operates the UrbanCincy blog, has made social media references to living in Chicago at the time he submitted the ballot. Also complicating the matter, Simes has since moved to South Korea on work assignment.

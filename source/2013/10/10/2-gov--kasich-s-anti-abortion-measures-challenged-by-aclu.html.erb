The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the State of Ohio to combat Gov. John Kasich’s relentless attacks on abortion clinics and public hospitals who perform abortions. The ACLU takes issue with three of the anti-abortion measures placed on next year’s state budget insisting the amendments have no place on a budget bill. The three amendments include showing a mother the heartbeat of a fetus before performing an abortion, banning public hospitals and abortion clinics from making transfer agreements that are require to keep clinics open and to create a new pregnancy program that moves state funds into private organizations that are banned from mentioning abortion services.

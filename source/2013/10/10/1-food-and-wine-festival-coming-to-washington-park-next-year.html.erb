Come next September Cincinnati will have its own Food and Wine Festival. At least that’s the hope of former dining editor for Cincinnati Magazine Dana Covrett and her partners. The group is hoping to have the festival Sept. 12 and 13 at Washington Park. A gaggle of executive chefs -- including Jean-Robert de Cavel -- are helping the group plan the festival, which will feature a large tasting tent with an emphasis on Cincinnati’s pork heritage, as well as education events and book signings.

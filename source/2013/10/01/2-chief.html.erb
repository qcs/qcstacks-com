As of yesterday, there's a new cop on the beat in Cincinnati and his name is Jeffrey Blackwell. As the new police chief, Blackwell brings experience and a fresh face to the city which has recently struggled with a rise in street crimes. Neighborhood leaders are looking for a smooth and speedy transition and hope that Blackwell will outlast his predecessor, who left within two years of accepting the post.

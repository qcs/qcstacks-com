Cincinnati&rsquo;s two mayoral candidates Roxanne Qualls and John Cranley announced Monday that they elevated two African American supporters to new roles in their staffs. Councilman Wendell Young would serve as Vice Mayor if Qualls is elected and Cranley announced that former Cincinnati mayor Dwight Tillery is now co-chair of his campaign. Both Qualls and Cranley are both angling for the key African American vote to win this year. Since Cincinnatians first started electing our mayors in 2001, this will be the first year there is no black candidate on the ballot.

The Cincinnati Reds take on the Pittsburgh Pirates tonight in a culmination of a long-fought battle to see who advances to continue to play baseball into the postseason. After a surprise injury to Mat Latos over the weekend, Reds&rsquo; Ace Johnny Cueto is scheduled to start at 8:07 p.m. tonight in Pittsburgh at PNC Park. Cueto has pitched only two games since returning from the disabled list, but is currently 5-2 with a 2.82 ERA.

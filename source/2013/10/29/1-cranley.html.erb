Cincinnati Mayoral-candidate John Cranley has agreed to pay back a two-year-old loan of $75,000 he received from his former development company for a portion of his East Price Hill Incline Village project. Cranley said he will repay the loan when the Incline Village project becomes profitable, which could take 10-to-15 years.

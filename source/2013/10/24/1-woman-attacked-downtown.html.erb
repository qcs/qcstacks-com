WCPO is reporting that a woman was attacked yesterday morning on her way to work, in downtown Cincinnati. Approximately 7:30am, two assailants attempted to relieve her of her purse but she was having none of it. A nearby video camera captured the incident, which shows the resilient woman resisting her attackers, after which she notified authorities and then strolled into the office and started her day. The story serves as a good reminder that downtown can still be dangerous but your attitude and response can go a long way in moving the needle on crime in this city.

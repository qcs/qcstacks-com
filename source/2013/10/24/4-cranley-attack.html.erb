Speaking of political controversies, the mud-slinging in the mayoral race continues by the day. The latest involves former Councilman candidate John Cranley alleging that his opponent, Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls’ position on the streetcar presents a conflict of interest, since her work as real-estate agent would indirectly benefit from the highly contentious project. Not so, says City Solicitor John Curp and Ohio Ethics Commission Executive Director Paul Nick– Cranley’s attack doesn’t hold water.

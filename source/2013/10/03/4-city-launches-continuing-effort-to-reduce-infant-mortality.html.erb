Before 2013 Cincinnatiâ€™s infant mortality rate was more than double the national average, but thanks to outreach from the Cincinnati Health Department and local officials the number has fallen by 52 percent. In an effort further reduce that rate, city officials announced Cradle Cincinnati, a new coalition to educate first-time parents living in areas with unnaturally high rates of infant mortality.

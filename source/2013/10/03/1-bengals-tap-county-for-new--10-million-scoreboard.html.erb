The Cincinnati Bengals officially requested Hamilton County buy the team a new  $10 million scoreboard by the start of the 2014 NFL Stadium. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to the county -- an arrangement in the team’s lease stipulates if new technology such as a scoreboard is installed in at least 14 other NFL teams stadium’s, the county must foot the bill for a similar item if the Bengals request it. It’s unclear where Hamilton County officials will come up with the money for the scoreboard since they barely came up with the funds to balance the stadium fund this year which doesn’t include the scoreboard. If the county refuses to buy the scoreboard, the team could buy it themselves and bill the county for it at a later date.

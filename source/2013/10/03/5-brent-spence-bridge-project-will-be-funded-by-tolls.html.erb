Like it or not, tolls will be an integral part of the funding to pay for the new Brent Spence Bridge project. Tolls could range from $1 - $2 and will be charged during a 40-year period to cover the $2.5 billion project to replace the 49-year-old bridge. Assuming no major hiccups, the project is slated to begin in 2015 and will be completed by 2019.

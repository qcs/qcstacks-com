As patrons of Cincinnatiâ€™s downtown casino continue to bring big money into the city, developers are planning big investments of their own in the neighboring Pendleton district. Broadway Square, a $26 million dollar endeavor, will bring both retail and residential properties within walking distance of Horseshoe. According to the developers, the project represents more affordable accommodations than other downtown properties and is expected to cater to casino employees.

Anybody that has accidentally butt-dialed someone knows that it can be extremely embarrassing, depending upon who's being called and the potential content of what can be overheard on the line. In some cases, it can also be the subject of a federal lawsuit.  Such is the case of a lawsuit filed against an assistant to the CEO of CVG, who allegedly overheard a conversation between board members discussing the demotion of her boss, embattled CEO Candace McGraw.

The owners of the old Enquirer building on Vine street in downtown are moving forward with a plan to convert the vacant building into two hotels, a Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites. The $27 million dollar effort will cater to both business and extended-stay clientele in search of downtown lodging just off Fountain Square. Immediate efforts are underway to get construction moving; customers could be relaxing in the new suites as early as 2015.

Hope you enjoyed these past few 60-degree days while they lasted, because this weekend is about to get a whole lot more like winter. An estimated 3 - 6 inches of snow and ice is expected to hit the area Friday. Saturday&rsquo;s high is going to top at only 26 degrees and a low of 16 degrees with a wind chill making it seem like it is in the single digits. There&rsquo;s a possibility of another round of snow and freezing rain Sunday morning. Looks like it&rsquo;s a good weekend to stay indoors and trim the tree.

During Sunday's loss to the Pittsburg Steelers, Bengals punter Kevin Huber suffered a hit that will force him onto the sidelines for the remainder of the season. As a result of the hit by Steelers linebacker Terrance Garvin, which many have deemed wholly unnecessary, Huber sustained a broken jaw and cracked vertebrae in his neck. Garvin is expected to be fined by the NFL this week.

A Cincinnati City Council Budget Committee effectively voted to prevent the city from lowering property taxes as planned by unanimously approving the allocation of $20 million in capital funding to the Martin Luther King Drive and Interstate 71 interchange project. The $106-million project is expected to produce somewhere between 5,900 and 7,300 jobs in and around the uptown area. The property tax savings to residents would have been an annual $10 per $100,000 home valuation after 2017.

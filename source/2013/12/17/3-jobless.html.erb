More than 36,000 Ohioans could lose unemployment benefits in December if Congress doesn&rsquo;t vote to extend emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed past Dec. 28. Another 128,600 would lose benefits in 2014 if Congress doesn&rsquo;t take action on the issue. The benefits currently cost the country more than $25 billion a year and would sustain or create more than 310,000 jobs by allowing the unemployed to buy goods and services.

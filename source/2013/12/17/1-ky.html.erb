The Cincinnati Enquirer has an in-depth story about what&rsquo;s at stake for the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline that&rsquo;s designed to carry natural gas liquids through Kentucky into refining facilities in the northeastern United States. The controversial project is slated to be up and running by 2015 and is set to pay out more than $140 million in easement payments to Ohio residents and another $40 million to those in Kentucky. The proposed route for the pipeline is pitting neighbor against neighbor and carries with it a range of environmental concerns, including risk for explosion or spilling. About 6,000 to 7,000 temporary jobs will be created during construction of the pipeline.

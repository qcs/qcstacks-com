Only 57 percent of students in Cincinnati are considered &ldquo;ready for kindergarten,&rdquo; according to education-focused Strive Partnership&rsquo;s executive director Greg Landsman. Landsman is heading up a new initiative called Preschool Promise that hopes to provide a preschool education to all local children. Landsman estimated it would take between $15-17 million per year to send all 3- and 4-year-old children in the city to preschool. The project still has far to go, however, and is currently exploring funding options such as private donations, a new property or income tax and having CPS appropriate money to the project.

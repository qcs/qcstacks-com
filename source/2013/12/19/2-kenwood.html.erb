Real estate developer Matt Daniels took the stand Tuesday and Wednesday to answer questions about his role in the bungled Kenwood Towne Place project. Daniels faces 23 counts of fraud, including being accused of defrauding Bank of America by providing false information for the construction loan. Daniels, who was paid a salary of $225,000, told the courtroom that he wished he would have given the project &ldquo;more time.&rdquo; The project is now under active development under the name the Kenwood Collection and is set to open in 2016.

Candace Klein&rsquo;s SoMoLend will likely be liquidated before it faces a Jan. 23 hearing where it is being accused of securities fraud. Klein and her partners are accused of selling unregistered securities and making false financial projections. Investors in SoMoLend accused the state of Ohio of causing the venture to fail because of a bias against crowd-funded ventures and possible investor fraud associated with such investments.

It&rsquo;s getting close to the time to make New Year&rsquo;s resolutions and Gov. Kasich made a number of them for Ohio in 2014. The governor&rsquo;s wish list includes increasing funding for infrastructure projects in Ohio, new anti- poverty measures and a possible tax cut. Kasich needs to do something to curb state unemployment because Ohio has experienced several months of stagnant job growth and currently ranks 43rd in the nation for job growth rate during the past 12 months. Kasich also said Ohio has an image problem and has teamed up with L Brands CEO Les Wexner to brainstorm a marketing plan for the state.

Willie Carden Jr. will be Cincinnati&rsquo;s interim city manager, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. John Cranley selected Carden, the Director of the Cincinnati Parks since 2000, to be the city manager after the resignation of Milton Dohoney. Carden oversaw the expansion of Over-the-Rhine&rsquo;s Washington Park and the creation of Smale Riverfront Park. Cincinnati&rsquo;s mayor can only suggest city manager candidates, while the final decision will ultimately be up to city council.

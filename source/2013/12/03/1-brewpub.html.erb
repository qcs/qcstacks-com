Former Listerman and Triple-Digit brewer Kevin Moreland will lead Over-the-Rhine&rsquo;s latest brewpub located in the former St. Paul&rsquo;s Church at 1429 Race Street. The brewpub will be named Taft&rsquo;s Ale House in homage of one of Cincinnati&rsquo;s most famous historical figures, William Howard Taft. The owners hope to have the brewpub open by fall of 2014.

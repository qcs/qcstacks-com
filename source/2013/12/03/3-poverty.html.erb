Here&rsquo;s another log to add to the fire in the East vs. West-side debate: Residents of Hyde Park, Mount Lookout and other wealthy Cincinnati communities live an average of 20 years longer than those in South Fairmont or Avondale. The Cincinnati Health Department published data detailing those living in wealthy, largely-white communities have a life expectancy of 83.2 to 87.8 years compared to those living in lower-income, black or urban Appalachian neighborhoods who have a life expectancy of 66.4 to 68.2 years. Cardiovascular disease, cancer and stroke are the top causes of death in the area, according to the data.

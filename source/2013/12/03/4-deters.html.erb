Some Hamilton County Democrats have requested that state officials investigate whether county prosecutor Joe Deters improperly voted in Symmes Township in November 2012. According to recent divorce filings, Deters was not living at the residence as early as July. Deters maintains his full compliance with the law and stipulates that he voted on November 5th from his downtown residence.

Cincinnati Public School&rsquo;s experiment to save the district from losing millions of dollars has so far been a resounding success, according to Assistant Superintendent Gabe Lofton. The savings came from enacting an open enrollment program that allows students who live outside of the Cincinnati Public School district limits to attend a CPS school. As a result of enrolling, $5,700 comes with the student to the district. More than 800 out-of-district students applied for open-enrollment this school year and about 600 were accepted and are currently attending more than 20 CPS schools. Before open enrollment students who wanted attend a CPS school had to pay a tuition fee.

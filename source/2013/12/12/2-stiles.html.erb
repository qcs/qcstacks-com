After the brief honeymoon of hopeful City Manager Willie Carden came to an end this week, City Council appointed interim City Manager Scott Stiles Wednesday to the post. But the move didn&rsquo;t come without it&rsquo;s fair share of controversy with some council members concerned with Stiles&rsquo; updated compensation package that raises Stiles&rsquo; annual salary to $240,000. If the city chooses someone other than Stiles to be the permanent city manager, Stiles would be demoted to an assistant city manager with a salary of $180,000, which is $30,000 more than the other assistant city manager. If on the other hand the theoretical permanent city manager relieves Stiles of his duty completely, the city is obligated to pay Stiles some form of salary until 2018, which allows Stiles to collect his full pension payment upon retirement.

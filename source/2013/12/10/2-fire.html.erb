Cincinnati Police and Fire Departments&rsquo; staffing problems are beginning to take their toll on much-needed services around the city. Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said the department is 200 officers short of its peak of a few years ago, which means it takes officers longer to respond to 911 calls and could possibly change the way the department polices the city. The fire department is 20 people below their minimum number of daily firefighters, which forces fire stations around the city to temporarily shutdown certain trucks and other pieces of equipment at stations that are not properly staffed.

The patriarch of the Mallory political dynasty, William Mallory Sr., died Tuesday morning at the age of 82. Mallory grew up in the West End and was raised by his working-class parents before being elected to the Ohio House in 1966 and staying in the seat for 28 years. Mallory&rsquo;s sons said their father instilled in them a sense of civic duty as all five contributed to their father&rsquo;s political successes. One of Mallory&rsquo;s biggest achievements was a lawsuit that struck-down the at-large voting system, which diluted black voting power and prevented blacks from becoming elected judges.

Cincinnati&rsquo;s Horseshoe Casino&rsquo;s revenue has fallen more than 11 percent since September, and 3.3 percent since October, according to reported profits from the casino. But don&rsquo;t feel too bad for the gambling powerhouse: they still managed to rake in more than $17.5 million in November alone. So far all of Ohio&rsquo;s casinos have earned $758 million this year.

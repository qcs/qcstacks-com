That didn&rsquo;t last long. John Cranley&rsquo;s choice for City Manager Willie Carden, the director of the Cincinnati Parks Department, withdrew his nomination Friday after criticism that Carden lives outside of city limits. In addition to residency concerns, the Cincinnati Enquirer uncovered an ethics probe that found Carden took pay from the private Parks Foundation and the city. Interim Acting City Manager Scott Stiles will continue to serve in the role until the Cranley administration concludes their search for a permanent replacement.

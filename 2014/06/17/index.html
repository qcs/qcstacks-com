        <p>State Representative Dale Mallory failed to report an Indian Hill’s lobbyists gifts of Bengals tickets and expensive dinners, according to an ethic investigation. Mallory, along with several other lawmakers, attended a December, 2009 Bengal’s playoff game that was paid for by John Rabenold of Axcess Financial. The next month the lawmakers also dined at Via Vite and Lindey’s in Columbus on Rabenold’s dime. Rabenold was fined $2,000 for providing gifts to lawmakers.

        <p>Steve Chabot&rsquo;s efforts to slash Section 8 funding by 10 percent failed last week by a vote of 279-to-127. Chabot&rsquo;s wish to cut $3 billion from low-income housing comes at a time when Cincinnati&rsquo;s need for low-income vouchers is on the rise. Chabot has said he is against Section 8 housing because it leads to increased crime and lower property values in neighborhoods with a lot of low-income tenants.

        <p>Former Bengals cheerleader Sarah Jones lost her defamation lawsuit against a gossip website where a user posted she had sex with half of the team&rsquo;s players. Jones had been awarded $338,000 by a lower court, which was overturned by 6th a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel. The court case, website, TheDirty.com, and its owner, Nik Richie, have been watched by online companies such as Google, eBay and Amazon because of its implications under the Communications Decency Act.

        <p>According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Cincinnati's regional airport will be the first in the nation to analyze the mobile devices of travelers to help alleviate congestion within it's terminals and security screening areas. The idea is intended to create a calmer atmosphere by leveraging technology similar to Apple's iBeacons, which gather and aggregate data about where passengers are concentrated in the facility and where the shortest lines are located.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://wvxu.org/post/council-likely-vote-week-lytle-park-historic-district">Council May Vote on Extension of Lytle Park Historic District</a></h2>
        <p>This August, a regulation that has governed the boundaries of the Lytle Park Historic District since 1964 is set to expire. Members of City Council are working hard to prevent that from happening and may vote on whether to grant an extension as early as this week. The extension will likely cover a smaller geographic area than the original boundary did; in the years since the initial designation, the district has shrunk due to a lack of regulations in the neighborhood.

        <p>Despite Mayor John Cranley trying to fast-track the passage of his city budget, some City Council members are crying foul that it&rsquo;s the first budget since 2001 to not be structurally sound. The dissenting Council members&rsquo; main complaints center around Cranley using one-time revenue sources to balance the budgets that may not be available in the future. In addition to the revenue controversy, the budget cuts $1.6 million to &ldquo;enterprise technology solutions&rdquo; that could lead toward software security breaches and compromise health records, income tax returns, traffic lights and other public services.

        <p>According to Business Courier, Cincinnati WaterWorks is ready to raise rates, yet again. This time, they're looking for 7.5% or roughly $17 per household, per year. According to officials, this increase is a result of average usage being down slightly and would allow the organization to maintain a balanced budget and triple-A bond rating. Council reaction was mixed, with some members questioning the annual move to raise rates, year after year. According to Councilman Winburn, rates for the organization have steadily increased 38% for the last 8 years.

        <p>President Barack Obama unveiled new EPA guidelines Monday and put Ohio&rsquo;s coal-fired power plants under the gun to clean up their acts. The proposal would mandate a 28 percent reduction in carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity by 2030, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Despite being a nationwide proposal, Ohio is particularly hard-hit by these regulations because nearly 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s energy comes from coal-fired plants.

        <p>Cincinnati City Councilman Chris Seelbach introduced a measure to establish a domestic partnership registry that would help pave the way for same-sex couples to possibly qualify for equal employee benefits. The measure unanimously passed council&rsquo;s Human Services Committee and is slated to be voted on by full council Wednesday. Couples looking to qualify for the program would need to show strong financial interdependency.

        <p>Reporting on data compiled from RealityTrac, WVXU notes that Campbell County, KY is 4th in the nation for flipping single-family residences. Just behind other ranked counties in Pennsylvania and Maryland, Campbell County met a number of criteria such as: at least 100 single-family residences flipped in the last year; an average return of 30% or more; unemployment rates below the national average, etc.

        <p>With the exception of a couple ordinances that couldn't muster majority approval, Mayor John Cranley's 2015 fiscal budget was adopted by Council yesterday. For his part, the mayor seems pleased and is looking forward to more freedom in future fiscal years. One outstanding issue that did not meet with the council's approval is the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/06/04/water-rate-increase-dead-for-now.html" target="_blank">water rate increase</a> requested by Cincinnati WaterWorks earlier this week.

        <p>A bill sponsored by suburban Cincinnati Republican John Becker would make it illegal for insurance providers to cover abortions even in cases of rape, incest and when a pregnancy threatens a mother&rsquo;s life. The bill, which had its first hearing yesterday, would also ban insurance coverage for public employees for birth control by means of intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs. Becker said he believed IUDs are considered an abortion, despite admitting he based that opinion on absolutely no medical evidence.

        <p>A large apartment complex, retail space and hotel valued at $80 million is in the works to be developed next to Newport on the Levee. The facility would contain about 230 apartments and 8,000 square feet of retail space. The developers plan to start work in September and hope to open 18 to 24 months later.

        <p>While tolls for the Brent Spence bridge replacement are an impending reality, at least one state is striving to make them as painless as possible. According to Business Courier, new legislation allowing for all-electronic tolling in the state of Ohio is headed to the Governor's desk for final approval. The implications? Hopefully any traffic imposed as a result of new toll-booths adjacent to the bridge will be eased. Oh– you'll also be photographed as you drive through the unmanned booths, so any violators beforewarned: you will be summarily subjected to public and monetary scrutiny.

        <p>Tickets for the upcoming LumenoCity event sold out within 12 minutes Monday and Vice Mayor David Mann wants to investigate if the tickets were distributed fairly. The city decided to offer free tickets after attendees at last year&rsquo;s event experienced overcrowding. Mann&rsquo;s calls for an investigation were prompted by some tickets being sold for $49 - $199 on eBay.

Chief among them, he envisions a safer campus environment, building upon the relationship between metro and UC police officers. Likewise, Cranley would like to see a more walking and biking paths in Burnett Woods, and even a pedestrian walkway above MLK drive.

        <p>Cincinnati jazz institution The Blue Wisp closed its doors Saturday, according to WCPO. In 2012 the club moved from its location on Eighth Street to the corner of Seventh and Race Streets and began offering dinner, lunch and Sunday brunch. Employees blamed the club&rsquo;s changing business model for its closure. It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not the club will reopen at another location.

        <p>With average student loan debt at an all-time high and interest rates on borrowing money at an historic low, some members of Congress are starting to focus on the inability for college students to refinance their mortgage rates. Democrats, including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, are proposing a deal to resolve that issue, which will undoubtedly run afoul of the 1%. The proposed deal aims to make up an imposed budget shortfall by raising tax rates on individuals making over $1 million dollars.

        <p>  The city of Middletown has been acting for years to push out its poor citizens, according to documents obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Middletown officials have enacted a series of measures including threatening tenants with losing housing assistance if they have delinquent water bills from years past, putting  “problematic” landlords through special audits and background checks all in favor of reducing the amount of low-income housing available in Middletown. The Middletown Public Housing Agency is currently under a civil rights review by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

        <p>Despite Mayor John Cranley trying to fast-track the passage of his city budget, some City Council members are crying foul that it&rsquo;s the first budget since 2001 to not be structurally sound. The dissenting Council members&rsquo; main complaints center around Cranley using one-time revenue sources to balance the budgets that may not be available in the future. In addition to the revenue controversy, the budget cuts $1.6 million to &ldquo;enterprise technology solutions&rdquo; that could lead toward software security breaches and compromise health records, income tax returns, traffic lights and other public services.

        <p>According to Business Courier, Cincinnati WaterWorks is ready to raise rates, yet again. This time, they're looking for 7.5% or roughly $17 per household, per year. According to officials, this increase is a result of average usage being down slightly and would allow the organization to maintain a balanced budget and triple-A bond rating. Council reaction was mixed, with some members questioning the annual move to raise rates, year after year. According to Councilman Winburn, rates for the organization have steadily increased 38% for the last 8 years.

        <p>President Barack Obama unveiled new EPA guidelines Monday and put Ohio&rsquo;s coal-fired power plants under the gun to clean up their acts. The proposal would mandate a 28 percent reduction in carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity by 2030, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Despite being a nationwide proposal, Ohio is particularly hard-hit by these regulations because nearly 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s energy comes from coal-fired plants.

The measure unanimously passed council&rsquo;s Human Services Committee and is slated to be voted on by full council Wednesday. Couples looking to qualify for the program would need to show strong financial interdependency.

        <p>A bill sponsored by suburban Cincinnati Republican John Becker would make it illegal for insurance providers to cover abortions even in cases of rape, incest and when a pregnancy threatens a mother&rsquo;s life. The bill, which had its first hearing yesterday, would also ban insurance coverage for public employees for birth control by means of intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs. Becker said he believed IUDs are considered an abortion, despite admitting he based that opinion on absolutely no medical evidence.

        <p>While tolls for the Brent Spence bridge replacement are an impending reality, at least one state is striving to make them as painless as possible. According to Business Courier, new legislation allowing for all-electronic tolling in the state of Ohio is headed to the Governor's desk for final approval. The implications? Hopefully any traffic imposed as a result of new toll-booths adjacent to the bridge will be eased. Oh– you'll also be photographed as you drive through the unmanned booths, so any violators beforewarned: you will be summarily subjected to public and monetary scrutiny.

Likewise, Cranley would like to see a more walking and biking paths in Burnett Woods, and even a pedestrian walkway above MLK drive.

Democrats, including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, are proposing a deal to resolve that issue, which will undoubtedly run afoul of the 1%. The proposed deal aims to make up an imposed budget shortfall by raising tax rates on individuals making over $1 million dollars.

        <p>  The city of Middletown has been acting for years to push out its poor citizens, according to documents obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Middletown officials have enacted a series of measures including threatening tenants with losing housing assistance if they have delinquent water bills from years past, putting  “problematic” landlords through special audits and background checks all in favor of reducing the amount of low-income housing available in Middletown. The Middletown Public Housing Agency is currently under a civil rights review by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Chabot has said he is against Section 8 housing because it leads to increased crime and lower property values in neighborhoods with a lot of low-income tenants.

Members of City Council are working hard to prevent that from happening and may vote on whether to grant an extension as early as this week. The extension will likely cover a smaller geographic area than the original boundary did; in the years since the initial designation, the district has shrunk due to a lack of regulations in the neighborhood.

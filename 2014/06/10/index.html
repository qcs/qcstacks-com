        <p>Tickets for the upcoming LumenoCity event sold out within 12 minutes Monday and Vice Mayor David Mann wants to investigate if the tickets were distributed fairly. The city decided to offer free tickets after attendees at last year&rsquo;s event experienced overcrowding. Mann&rsquo;s calls for an investigation were prompted by some tickets being sold for $49 - $199 on eBay.

        <p>Cincinnati jazz institution The Blue Wisp closed its doors Saturday, according to WCPO. In 2012 the club moved from its location on Eighth Street to the corner of Seventh and Race Streets and began offering dinner, lunch and Sunday brunch. Employees blamed the club&rsquo;s changing business model for its closure. It&rsquo;s unclear whether or not the club will reopen at another location.

        <p>With average student loan debt at an all-time high and interest rates on borrowing money at an historic low, some members of Congress are starting to focus on the inability for college students to refinance their mortgage rates. Democrats, including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, are proposing a deal to resolve that issue, which will undoubtedly run afoul of the 1%. The proposed deal aims to make up an imposed budget shortfall by raising tax rates on individuals making over $1 million dollars.

        <p>  The city of Middletown has been acting for years to push out its poor citizens, according to documents obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Middletown officials have enacted a series of measures including threatening tenants with losing housing assistance if they have delinquent water bills from years past, putting  “problematic” landlords through special audits and background checks all in favor of reducing the amount of low-income housing available in Middletown. The Middletown Public Housing Agency is currently under a civil rights review by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

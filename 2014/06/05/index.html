        <p>With the exception of a couple ordinances that couldn't muster majority approval, Mayor John Cranley's 2015 fiscal budget was adopted by Council yesterday. For his part, the mayor seems pleased and is looking forward to more freedom in future fiscal years. One outstanding issue that did not meet with the council's approval is the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/06/04/water-rate-increase-dead-for-now.html" target="_blank">water rate increase</a> requested by Cincinnati WaterWorks earlier this week.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/06/04/bill-would-restrict-abortion-coverage.html">Cincinnati Republican Sponsors Draconian Anti-Abortion Bill</a></h2>
        <p>A bill sponsored by suburban Cincinnati Republican John Becker would make it illegal for insurance providers to cover abortions even in cases of rape, incest and when a pregnancy threatens a mother&rsquo;s life. The bill, which had its first hearing yesterday, would also ban insurance coverage for public employees for birth control by means of intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs. Becker said he believed IUDs are considered an abortion, despite admitting he based that opinion on absolutely no medical evidence.

        <p>Urban Cincy recently posted a fascinating look at the Cincinnati's urban neighborhoods over time, compiled via Google Street images. The visual walk down revitalization-lane of the last decade has been making the rounds on social media this week.  The post highlights a number of city blocks that are almost unrecognizable today– be sure to check it out.

        <p>A large apartment complex, retail space and hotel valued at $80 million is in the works to be developed next to Newport on the Levee. The facility would contain about 230 apartments and 8,000 square feet of retail space. The developers plan to start work in September and hope to open 18 to 24 months later.

        <p>While tolls for the Brent Spence bridge replacement are an impending reality, at least one state is striving to make them as painless as possible. According to Business Courier, new legislation allowing for all-electronic tolling in the state of Ohio is headed to the Governor's desk for final approval. The implications? Hopefully any traffic imposed as a result of new toll-booths adjacent to the bridge will be eased. Oh– you'll also be photographed as you drive through the unmanned booths, so any violators beforewarned: you will be summarily subjected to public and monetary scrutiny.

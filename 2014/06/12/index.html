        <p>When Kentucky lawmakers recently failed to secure proper funding for the Brent Spence Bridge replacement project and even attempted to ban the use of toll-booths statewide, Ohio Governor John Kasich took note. And after signing legislation yesterday that paves the way for Ohio's investment in the same project, he signaled to his southern counterparts that its time to get real. He called Kentucky's lack of movement on the issue "unacceptable" and termed the project a major initiative for the entire region. Get it together, Kentucky!

        <p>Hamilton County Commissioners will soon consider raising the county&rsquo;s 6.75 percent sales tax to fund much-needed improvement construction projects at Union Terminal and Music Hall. The sales tax hike proposal was put forth by the Cultural Facilities Task Force, a group of high-powered community and business leaders including former chairman and CEO of Proctor & Gamble, Bob McDonald. A cost estimate done by The Cincinnati Enquirer reported close to $150 million was needed to repair the ailing Union Terminal while a $100 million was required for Music Hall.

        <p>On Thursday, Mayor John Cranley is expected to release a progress report on the revitalization of East Price Hill, a three-month collaborative effort aiming to reduce crime and improve the quality of life for it's residents. The Neighborhood Enhancement Program is a attempt to 'turbo-charge' redevelopment over 90 days, following an accidental death of an eight year old boy in March.

        <p>City Council passed legislation Wednesday to move forward to help fund for-profit Cincy Bike Lanes with their mission to spread the benefits of biking across the Queen City. The motion passed by council gives the startup $1.1 million to jump start their operation, but the group estimates needing another $1 million to get fully off the ground. Once funded the bike sharing program hopes to have 300 bikes available for rent from 35 stations across downtown, Over-the-Rhine and uptown.

        <p>After a 12 minute sellout this week, some of the planners involved with the wildly successful LumenoCity event have started discussing another installment, this one projected against the historic Cincinnati Museum Center. Organizers have cited funding to be at least one problem– though if the rapid fervor for tickets is any indication, something tells me it won't be for lack of interest. Perhaps a minimal face value for the tickets is in order?

        <p>A study looking at how much it would cost annually to operate the forthcoming Cincinnati streetcar found the amount would be higher than it was projected in December. The study found that the new annual operating cost would be $2.6 million in 2017 and rise to $3.85 million by 2025. The original costs were expected to be between $1.88 million and $2.44 million. Another report done by internal auditing firm KPMG estimated annual operating costs to be $4 million in 2017 and up to $5.56 million in 2025.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley wants to extend the timeline for Interim City Manager Scott Stiles' contract through the end of August, according to a report by Business Courier. The mayor cites the budget and other development deals as the primary cause for delay in his recommendation for a permanent replacement. The extension will require a vote by City Council, which already has a pretty hectic schedule ahead of it.

        <p>Democratic candidate Ed FitzGerald will be courting younger voters when he takes on John Kasich for governor of Ohio this fall. FitzGerald announced his desires to expand a college savings program he launched as a Cuyahoga County executive. The plan would place $100 of public money into a kindergartener&rsquo;s account. The money could only be used on college expenses. The goal of the program is to help people to start saving for college earlier and to plant the seed in children&rsquo;s minds that college is a destination that everyone can attend.

        <p>One of Cincinnati's regional, premier attractions wants (more) of your tax dollars, at the potential expense of blowing the deal entirely. At issue is whether or not to put a sales or property tax increase on the ballot this November to help finance rehabilitation of Music Hall and Union Terminal. While that debate is just getting underway, Zoo Director Thane Maynard has indicated to Hamilton County Commissioners that his organization wants some of that sweet revenue action too. Some commissioners have already thrown cold water on the idea.

        <p>Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell proposed ending the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act that regulates prevailing wages on federally funded projects as a way to help pay for the Brent Spence Bridge Project. It&rsquo;s highly unlikely McConnell&rsquo;s idea would pass the Democratic-controlled Senate, but he claims it would have saved $13 billion over 10 years. Alison Lundergan Grimes, McConnell&rsquo;s challenger for his Senate seat this fall, proposed paying for the bridge by eliminating some tax breaks for corporations.

        <p>Think some of your work meetings go on longer than they need to? You won’t find any sympathy from members of the Cincinnati Historic Conservation Board who spent close to 7 hours discussing the fate of two historic Over-the-Rhine buildings. The board reached a decision Monday to prevent the demolition of the buildings located near the corner of Central Parkway and Main Street. The owner is pushing to demolish the buildings because he said it would be too expensive to remodel.

Thankfully the owner of Pet Wants, Michele Hobbs, wants to remedy that problem by opening a distillery in Over-the-Rhine in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse and attached garage. The new distillery will be named Born Again Distillery and will produce gin, whiskey and bourbon.

        <p>Tracie Hunter’s long, strange journey took another turn this week when a third juror recanted their guilty verdict. The juror’s announcement comes on the heels of two other jurors who also recanted their guilty verdicts after implying the other jurors pressured them to convict Hunter. All three jurors who recanted their votes are black and the most recent juror to recant said she was racially pressured by the white jury foreman to convict. A decision will be made next week if Hunter receives a new trial.

        <p>Cincinnati is one of 38 cities in the United States to receive a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign on its municipal equality index. The score reflects a city’s laws and policies protecting sexual and gender identity. Some of the reasons the group gave Cincinnati such high marks is because it extended benefits to same-sex partners of city employees and its requirement that all city contractors sign non-discrimination agreements.

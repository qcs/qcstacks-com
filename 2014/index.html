        <p>Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune intends to challenge Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald for the primary seat in this year's gubernatorial race. Portune's move ruffled feathers of some Democrats who claim devoting resources to a primary campaign would hamper their chances of winning the November election. <a href="http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/06/portune-fitzgeralds-commitment-to-blacks-appalling/">Portune also took a stab</a> at Fitzgerald in an email obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer where he claimed Fitzgerald's "lack of connection or commitment to the African American community is both amazing and appalling."

        <p>An uptick in homicides in Over-the-Rhine toward the end of 2013 pushed Cincinnati's homicide rate to 15.5 per 100,000 for last year, which is more than 10 points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000. New Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell and Councilman Christopher Smitherman agreed the majority of the homicides were black-on-black and few were random in nature. Blackwell told City Council the department is "significantly short of police officers."

        <p>Following the loss of a federal grant which accounted for nearly 13% of its budget, Neighborhood Health Inc. was forced to close four clinics in the Greater Cincinnati area at the end of 2013. As a result, nearly 20,000 area patients will be left without access to medical services for at least the first quarter of the year. Among those affected are pregnant women receiving prenatal care and other	 patients suffering from severe conditions such as diabetes and chronic heart problems.

        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals are in the market for a new offensive coordinator after Jay Gruden agreed to a 5-year deal to become the Washington Redskins&rsquo; head coach next season. Gruden has been with Bengals since 2011 and played a key figure in both seasons of HBO&rsquo;s Hard Knocks series that focused on the Bengals in training camp. Gruden&rsquo;s Bengals ranked 10th in total yards per game and sixth in points per game for the 2013 season.

Cranley threatened to replace the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority board after their offer to control the streetcar&rsquo;s operating costs. Cranley might want to look into his powers on that threat since City Council, not the mayor, sets SORTA appointments.

John Kasich&rsquo;s adversaries during this election year. Upon taking office in 2010, Kasich claimed his tax cuts and privatization efforts would create economic growth for Ohio. The Buckeye State has dropped from 34th to 26th nationally in private-sector job growth since January 2010.

        <p>Welcome to 2014, employees! Cincinnati-based retailer Macy&rsquo;s announced in a statement it will be laying off 2,500 employees in an effort to reduce costs and because of other organizational changes. The layoffs should save the mega-retailer about $100 million per year and all those affected by the layoffs will be eligible for severance. Despite the cost-cutting moves, Macy&rsquo;s is planning to add staff to other positions within the company, which should keep its workforce around 175,000.

The Port Authority was designed to become the main economic-development driver in the region, but a lack of funding has impeded its efforts. Part of the monetary struggles stem from Mayor John Cranley killing the parking privatization plan, which would have given the Port Authority at least $18 million over 30 years. Duke&rsquo;s donation will mainly impact Bond Hill and surrounding neighborhoods.

        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s acting City Manager Scott Stiles announced a big shake up in the city&rsquo;s core leadership positions this week. Most notably City Solicitor John Curp will leave his current position to head up the city&rsquo;s Metropolitan Sewer and Water districts. Some, including councilmembers P.G. Sittenfeld and Chris Seelbach, say the move was retribution from Mayor John Cranley as Curp favored both the parking privatization plan and the streetcar project, both of which Cranley was against. Bill Moller, a city retiree, was hired as the assistant city manager, which allows Moller to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; into pension and a new city salary at $147,000.

It was the first time that exact mixture of drugs has been used for the death penalty in the United States.

        <p>Embattled Hamilton County Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter has entered a plea of 'not guilty' in connection with her recent alleged felonies.

        <p>Good news transit fans, the streetcar project is on budget and schedule per a recent report by project executive John Deatrick.  Also noted recently were estimated consumer pricing for riding said streetcar: $1.75 for two hours and $3.50 for 24 hours. At that price point, officials have projected 3,000 daily commuters but caution that these estimates do not take special events into account.

        <p>Since we clearly don't have enough corporate sponsorship already and the owners of the Bengals franchise haven't bled every possible cent from county taxpayers, the team now wants naming rights for Paul Brown Stadium in exchange for not opposing certain new developments at the Banks. Naming rights can be a big deal and mean big money to professional sports teams, as evidenced by Citigroup's recent $400 million dollar endorsement of the New York Met's ballpark.

        <p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a shortage of controversy surrounding whether or not fracking contaminates drinking water in the media lately. The environmental effects caused by the process of extracting natural gas from shale deposits is the focus of a study currently being conducted by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. The researchers are taking water samples for the Utica Shale region of Carroll County, Ohio, which is about 250 miles northeast of Cincinnati. Since 2010 Ohio has received more than 190 complaints of contaminants in drinking water.

        <p>So Hamilton County needs a new crime lab and the Board of Elections has voiced some need in recent year to relocate, due to space. Could a mutual solution be to move the Board of Elections to the old crime lab space in Mt. Airy? Not so fast, say local democrats. The proposed move could place an undue burden on low-income voters who live downtown and lack the transportation to get out to vote come election time. Making matters worse, the county commissioners need to make a decision on this before the end of the month.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy investigation on the city&rsquo;s rising debt levels, which have increased threefold in the last 20 years.  One of John Cranley&rsquo;s promises when running for mayor was the completion of the Interstate 71 and Martin Luther King interchange project, which the city has already borrowed $20 million to help finish the project. It&rsquo;s of course unfair to blame Cranley for the city&rsquo;s rising debt, but his promises certainly don&rsquo;t help. Cincinnati is carrying an annual $1.1 billion debt, which means the city is paying $118 million per year in debt payments. Carrying debt isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, however, but it could mean bond agencies could downgrade the city&rsquo;s creditworthiness.

In its 95th year, the parade will come south down Elm before hanging a left on Fifth Street to rejoin the normal route that runs alongside Fountain Square. The festivities kick-off at noon with the Redlegs facing the St. Louis Cardinals later that afternoon.

        <p>Despite an annual intake of $92 million, some businesses at The Banks are struggling, according to a detailed investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Those struggling businesses complain that the area is missing key pieces such as a hotel, office tower or grocery store. There's some hope for the businesses, however, with a 291 apartments and 19,000 square-feet of retail space planned for development soon, which will bring the total amount spent by taxpayers to $127.7 million.

        <p>Pro-streetcar advocates are plotting to expand the streetcar's route another mile toward Uptown despite mounting challenges from detractors. A number of challenges, including an important power line to the city that runs underneath Vine Street and an unbudging Mayor John Cranley, threaten derail the plans of connecting Downtown to Uptown. Streetcar supporters maintain that connecting the two key business districts is crucial for the system's long-term success. John Deatrick, who is managing the streetcar project, said he and his team are currently figuring out if completing Uptown route will keep the project on its $128 million budget.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley is looking for five votes on Cincinnati City Council to approve his recommended plan for the city's parking system. Under Cranley's plan the city's Parking Services Department would continue to run the maintenance and operation of the city's meters and garages, according to The Cincinnati Business Courier. The plan calls for about $25	 million in revenue bonds to improve the city's parking systems and expects an eventual return of $7.4 million per year.

If the city decides to opt out of its lease with the Port Authority it will lose a one-time windfall of $85 million and cost taxpayers $1 million to pull out of the lease.

The vote to move the BOE was divided along party lines and decided by Republican Ohio Secretary of State, John Husted. When the office moves in several years it will make Hamilton County the first urban county in Ohio not to have its election offices downtown. Democrats fear the move will restrict early voting for those living downtown without access to a car. It would take roughly two hours by bus to make the round-trip commute from Government Square to the new election offices.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has the votes he needs to set up an Office for Minority Inclusion at City Hall and $175,000 to spend on a consultant to study the city&rsquo;s minority contracting. Both initiatives are a result of the city&rsquo;s poor record of rewarding contracts to minority- and female-owned businesses. Last year the city awarded three percent of contracts to African-American owned businesses, six percent to women-owned businesses and none to Hispanic contractors, according to WVXU.

        <p>The closing of four community health clinics impacting as many as 10,000 children and adults could have been a result of spiteful letter sent by the health department who operated the clinics, according to Mayor John Cranley.

The letter, dated October 14, 2013 and signed by the health department&rsquo;s chief financial officer Joyce Tate, criticized a merger with Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s HealthPoint as a way to prop up the financially struggling Neighborhood Health Centers.

        <p>Following lots of momentum from city council and former Mayor Mark Mallory, the deal to construct a new high-rise apartment complex on the corner of Fourth and Race streets appears to be stalled, if not dead completely. Mayor John Cranley has opposed any further relocation negotiations with Paragon Salons, the remaining tenant who's lease runs through 2017. If the deal does fall through, that will leave the city on the hook for maintenance repairs to Pogue's garage, which will reportedly come in higher than the cost to relocate Paragon.

        <p>Is Cincinnati going less green this year? That seems like a likely scenario, should interim City Manager Scott Stiles get his way. In effort to reduce household costs by roughly $5 over the course of the year, Stiles has decided to buy conventional, fossil-fuel energy over renewable energy via the city's electric aggregation program. This is a disappointing decision as Cincinnati has made some significant strides in reducing greenhouse gases in recent years.

This may come as good news to daily commuters but no one actually knows where the money will come from. Experts have long agreed that tolls are the only way to raise the more than $2 billion dollars it will take to replace the bridge.

The negotiations would most likely include a temporary stop to cost-of-living increases, reduced health benefits and an annual city contribution to the pension fund. Mayor John Cranley says the plan is necessary to deal with the $870 million unfunded pension.

        <p>Hamilton County Township fiscal officer Jackie Terwilleger resigned Friday after an investigation discovered $2 million in mismanaged funds, falsified checks and unauthorized payments. Warren County officials question why no precaution was taken after Terwilleger&rsquo;s books were called into question in 2004 after an auditor warning. A public hearing of the township&rsquo;s finances is scheduled for April 5.

        <p>Yesterday, City Council approved a plan designed to settle the city's looming pension debacle, once and for all. The path forward, advanced by Mayor John Cranley requires the city to negotiate the terms of the settlement in federal court, hopefully including all city employees as part of a mandatory class action lawsuit. The terms of the negotiation will include a cap on cost of living increases and the reduction of health benefits for retirees.

Neuhardt said Kasich&rsquo;s reasoning that cutting the income tax by 8.5 percent would benefit single mothers is &ldquo;despicable and wrong.&rdquo; CityBeat reports that Kasich&rsquo;s previous budget started pushing the state&rsquo;s top tax rate below 5 percent and raising the sales tax, tactics that disproportionately favor the wealthiest citizens. Neuhardt said if the governor was interested in helping single mothers he should do so with meaningful reforms, not tax cuts.

"Seriously. I mean, 3 to 5 (percent) &mdash; wow."

        <p>With opening day just under a week away, Reds fans start 2014 with a bit of anxiety as their team has been plagued with a plethora of off-season injuries. In addition to the injured players the Reds are knee-deep in expensive multiyear deals with Homer Bailey, Brandon Phillips, Jay Bruce and Joey Votto. Four of the Reds pitchers&rsquo; contracts also expire in the next year or two, which means unless big things happen soon the the small-market Reds might face a few years of rebuilding. The Reds open the season at Great American Ballpark next Monday at 4:10 p.m. vs. the Saint Louis Cardinals.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has his sights on turning Burnet Woods into something like New York City&rsquo;s Central Park.

Cranley said Burnet Woods&rsquo; current state is &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an enormous asset that&rsquo;s underutilized.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s plan includes linking the park to the University of Cincinnati campus by use of a pedestrian bridge over Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Despite being on Cranley&rsquo;s wish list, the project wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day until at least 2016.

        <p>It's been a wild ride for the controversial Brent Spence Bridge replacement project. First, Kentucky lawmakers banned the use of tolls on interstate highways running through Kentucky and then voted to strip millions of dollars previously allocated for the construction effort. Both actions served to irk area business leaders but thankfully, the committee has decided to reverse course on the initial funding provision. While the senate will still have to pass the bill for it to become a reality, the reversal has many enthusiasts resting a little easier today.

According to WVXU, there are approximately 100 Sumatran rhinos left so the Cincinnati Zoo has been working tirelessly to develop techniques for breeding them in captivity.

The three-week pause in construction cost the city almost $1 million, which includes more than $637,000 in downtime for contractors. The December delay will add approximately 20 days to the project completion date of April 4, 2016. Passengers are still expected to be able to ride the streetcar in September 2016.

        <p>Smale Riverfront Park continues to rake in the cash. The park just secured a combined total of $12.5 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the City of Cincinnati for improvements and upgrades to the park. The Engineers gave the money to the park to pay for erosion and flooding control along the Ohio River and the city&rsquo;s money will go toward other improvements such as Heekin/PNC Grow Up Great Adventure Playground. The park still needs an additional $5 million to be completed by 2017.

        <p>The class-action lawsuit filed by Fifth Third employees in 2008 regarding massive cuts in employee&rsquo;s retirement accounts was held this week in the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the employees claim Fifth Third executives knew their stock had become risky, but continued to invest in the company stock plan that funds the employees' retirement accounts. Fifth Third stock dropped 75 percent from July 2007 to September 2009, which cost employees tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether or not employees can sue their companies over retirement plan losses.

        <p>Despite the millions being made by Ohio universities from student athletes, Republican lawmakers are determined the athletes don&rsquo;t see a dime. After football players at Northwestern University were granted the right to unionize, Ohio Republicans quickly introduced legislation that would prevent any Ohio college athletes from doing anything similar. The law states that college athletes are not employees and therefore have no right to unionize against their employer.

The resulting suspensions encouraged similar reciprocal suspensions in Ohio, thus preventing him from practicing law in either state for some time.

Under the proposal, parking would be restricted along the route during rush hour on adjacent sides of the street based on the time of day. Opponents of the plan think alternate solutions should be considered as restricting parking could hurt business.

John Kasich and his across-the-board income tax cuts as a cause for the city&rsquo;s decline in public services. Cincinnati has received 50 percent decrease in local government funding during the last two years. In addition to the $12 million cut form the local government fund, Gov. Kasich also repealed the estate tax that played a large part in funding local government. A report from Policy Matters, a non-profit policy research organization, found that state aid to local communities has decreased $1.1 billion since the 2011-12 fiscal year.

        <p>The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&rsquo; and business owners&rsquo; concerns.

According to the plea deal he copped last week, Eaton has admitted to using his university issued credit-card for buying personal items such as groceries and had even accepted thousands of dollars in inappropriate reimbursements from the school. His formal sentencing next month will close a case that first gained regional attention when Eaton was fired in March 2013.

        <p>Slowly but surely Cincinnati&rsquo;s economy is showing signs of being on the up-and-up. Recent news from a report by a local real estate firm shows the local industrial vacancy rate fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The vacancy rate hasn&rsquo;t dropped below 6 percent in seven years, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. A lower vacancy rate means companies are hiring developers to construct new buildings.

        <p>Cincinnati is all abuzz this week about the latest bike-lane dust-up. At issue is a plan from the former city administration to install a protected bike lane on either side of Central Parkway. Following some concerns voiced by business leaders and members of city council, Mayor Cranley decided to re-debate the issue until all misgivings were officially put to bed (again). In short, this delay has not only yielded a new compromise that will cost the city an additional $100,000 but also widened the gap between opposing council factions. If council fails to accept the compromise, the project may be dead entirely.

        <p>A couple weeks ago, in the wake of a report stating that there had been 22 homicides in the first quarter of 2014, Councilman Chris Smitherman made some controversial statements about violent crime within the black community. Those statements have erupted into calls for his replacement as chairman of the Law and Public Safety Committee. Last night, Mayor Cranley rejected those appeals and stood behind Smitherman and the work he's done in that position.

According to Mallory, he missed at least 2 of those sessions due to dealing with sickness in his family.

        <p>The much maligned teacher contract put forth by the Cincinnati Archdiocese won&rsquo;t be changing any time soon. The contract includes a stipulation that prevents employees from supporting issues that run counter to Catholic teaching such as homosexuality, in vitro fertilization, living together outside of wedlock and other positions are not based in the 1800s. According to the superintendent of the Archdiocese fewer than six teachers have refused to sign the contract. The Archdiocese controls 113 schools in 19 counties.

        <p>Now that&rsquo;s a long con. City employee Marc Corsmeier pleaded guilty to stealing nearly $20 thousand in quarters from city parking meters during an 8-year period. Corsmeier stole about $50 per week after starting on the job in 2007. Another city employee noticed coins in the bottom of Corsmeier&rsquo;s gym bag and contacted police who confiscated the gym bag and found the stolen quarters. Corsmeier has been placed on probation for three years and is prevented from working for the public again.

        <p>Before the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1st, the city is required to pass a new budget and Mayor John Cranley has just released his plans to do so. According to the administration, his is the first balanced budget in more than a decade &mdash; that is, for every dollar spent, another dollar is cut. Further, the new budget hasn't proposed any layoffs or raised any taxes and also manages to close a $22MM budget gap. The only catch? It relies on a favorable federal judgement of the current mediation between the City and municipal employees.

        <p>Thanks to a more positive financial outlook, City Council has approved two ordinances that relax some requirements on developers and paves the way for a new Holiday Inn to be built on the corner of 7th and Broadway Streets. Business Courier reports that the ordinances revise a development agreement from 2011 in a number of ways, most notably, removing a reference to the funding source of a new garage on Sycamore. Council has agreed that the city should pay for the new garage but has no idea how do that.

The result of that effort has concluded and the HCSO says its key areas of concern are pretty much what you'd expect: staffing, technology, and training. While the report contains praise for the officers it also states that they are resistant to change.

        <p>If you're a politics nerd, you know that mid-term elections are this fall so it should come as no surprise that the persistent war to limit voting eligibility is back on, again. And Ohio, being the swing-state that it is, is one of the hottest battle grounds for this sort of shenanigan, most often perpetrated by right-wing conservatives. In recent years, Secretary of State Jon Husted went to extraordinary lengths to limit early voting hours. And more recently, the dust-up about whether to move the Board of Elections out of downtown has caused a stir among political operatives here at home.

Retired city architect Jack Martin is a leading investor. Plans are to have the brewery up and running by spring of next year.

        <p>City officials and planners are floating the idea of leveraging the Western Hills viaduct for new transit options into downtown. The crumbling bridge, which has been named one of the worst in the country, has been estimated to need at least $240MM in repairs– a huge sum for any cash-strapped city and some see the additional transit corridor as a way to sweeten the deal. Michael Moore, Cincinnati's director of transportation and engineering will present the idea to council's transportation committee next week.

        <p>As Cincinnati city planners and transportation officials discuss rehabilitation or replacement of the Western Hills Viaduct, some residents are voicing their desire to include light rail in the plan. WVXU reports that the additional transit lines for rail could add approximately $50 million to the project but would help to connect more than 20% of the city's residents to the urban core.

        <p>Not to be outdone by big brother's recent developments along the river, Covington is looking to up it's game with big plans for KY's most picturesque, waterside real estate. City officials want to transform the south-side of the riverbank into a "waterfront activity center" with walkable trails, recreational pavilions and more under a new project that's being dubbed <a href="http://www.southbankpartners.com/projects/riverfront-commons.aspx" target="blank">Riverfront Commons</a>. The plan calls for development from the Purple People Bridge in Newport to Devou Park in Covington and will hopefully be funded in part by grants from the US Department of Transportation.

        <p>Thanks to regional cooperation, the Greater Cincinnati area was awarded a federal designation this week which should result in better opportunities for regional development efforts. The designation comes due in part to the 'aerospace corridor', the aerial traffic lane which runs between NKY and Dayton, OH and should not only give the region preferential treatment on federal grant applications over the next two years but will also appropriate a federal liaison to help with the complicated process of applying for future grants.

        <p>The Columbus Dispatch reports today that a Federal Judge has placed a moratorium on future executions by lethal injection in the state until he can learn more about the new drugs being used. Following last month’s botched execution of Dennis McGuire, in which the inmate was seen visibly gasping and choking, states are scrambling to come up a process to ensure that future efforts do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly since that controversial incident, a number of court challenges have been filed against the state alleging a violation of inmate’s constitutional rights.

        <p>Despite Mayor John Cranley trying to fast-track the passage of his city budget, some City Council members are crying foul that it&rsquo;s the first budget since 2001 to not be structurally sound. The dissenting Council members&rsquo; main complaints center around Cranley using one-time revenue sources to balance the budgets that may not be available in the future. In addition to the revenue controversy, the budget cuts $1.6 million to &ldquo;enterprise technology solutions&rdquo; that could lead toward software security breaches and compromise health records, income tax returns, traffic lights and other public services.

        <p>According to Business Courier, Cincinnati WaterWorks is ready to raise rates, yet again. This time, they're looking for 7.5% or roughly $17 per household, per year. According to officials, this increase is a result of average usage being down slightly and would allow the organization to maintain a balanced budget and triple-A bond rating. Council reaction was mixed, with some members questioning the annual move to raise rates, year after year. According to Councilman Winburn, rates for the organization have steadily increased 38% for the last 8 years.

The proposal would mandate a 28 percent reduction in carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity by 2030, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer. Despite being a nationwide proposal, Ohio is particularly hard-hit by these regulations because nearly 70 percent of the state&rsquo;s energy comes from coal-fired plants.

        <p>Steve Chabot&rsquo;s efforts to slash Section 8 funding by 10 percent failed last week by a vote of 279-to-127. Chabot&rsquo;s wish to cut $3 billion from low-income housing comes at a time when Cincinnati&rsquo;s need for low-income vouchers is on the rise. Chabot has said he is against Section 8 housing because it leads to increased crime and lower property values in neighborhoods with a lot of low-income tenants.

        <p>This August, a regulation that has governed the boundaries of the Lytle Park Historic District since 1964 is set to expire. Members of City Council are working hard to prevent that from happening and may vote on whether to grant an extension as early as this week. The extension will likely cover a smaller geographic area than the original boundary did; in the years since the initial designation, the district has shrunk due to a lack of regulations in the neighborhood.

        <p>Nobody disagrees that two of the city's most notable landmarks are in need of major repair, but there remains much disagreement on how to finance that effort. Next month, Hamilton County Commissioners will confront the material issues that face the iconic Music Hall and Union Terminal buildings by holding a public forum on whether to raise funds by modestly increasing sales taxes.

The money could only be used on college expenses. The goal of the program is to help people to start saving for college earlier and to plant the seed in children&rsquo;s minds that college is a destination that everyone can attend.

In 2007 close to 70 percent of the money used to support local schools came from homeowners and farmers, a dramatic increase from 46 percent in 1991. The extra burden on homeowners and farmers is a result of phasing out the tax on the tangible personal property of businesses and commercial properties.

        <p>There&rsquo;s a number of Internet accelerators in Cincinnati all of which trade their much-needed money for an equity stake in a start-up&rsquo;s business, but one accelerator focuses on manufactured phsyical products instead. First Batch is a four-month accelerator program that partners entrepreneurs with manufacturers and $8,000 in grant funding to jumpstart the production of a new product. Ohio Valley Beard Supply, a company that creates beard elixirs, and Switcher, which creates multiple camera controls, are just two of this year&rsquo;s crop of students at First Batch.

For states like Kentucky, who haven't gotten their act together in the ensuing near-decade, residents may be the ones to suffer the consequences.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley chose Balitmore&rsquo;s finance director Harry Black to become Cincinnati&rsquo;s next city manager. If City Council approves Cranley’s choice, Black will replace Interim City Manager Scott Stiles. Black’s nickname when he was chief financial officer of Richmond, Virginia was “Mr. Pitbull.” Black has plenty of experience in government, but never as a city manager.

        <p>Remember those barriers that the police erected in OTR a few months ago to curb prostitution? Well, apparently they were so successful that they turned the neighborhood in a "ghost town". At least that's the perspective of a plaintiff who's recently filed charges against the city in federal court this week. Among the chief complaints are that public transportation is now totally inaccessible, preventing many residents accessing grocery stores or doctor's appointments.

        <p>In a letter to the state of Ohio the University of Cincinnati suggested it should not have to pay taxes on the Emery Theater. The letter comes on the heels of a complaint filed by the Cincinnati Public Schools that says the Emery theater and apartment buildings should lose its tax-exempt status. CPS argued because the theater is no longer in use, it doesn&rsquo;t have an educational value for UC. If the state agrees with CPS, the theater would have an annual tax bill of $20,000 and 65 percent of that would go toward CPS.

        <p>Despite a 6-0 vote from City Council to put $10 million toward saving Music Hall and Union Terminal over 25 years, Hamilton County Commissioners might drop Music Hall from this fall's ballot.

Commissioner Chris Monzel is in favor of booting Music Hall from the ballot as well, saying that Hamilton County only has ties to Union Terminal, home to the Museum Center.

        <p>Nobody said this was going to be easy. The Cincinnati Streetcar Project received news that they are not receiving a $5 million federal grant to help pay for operating costs of the project. The loss of the funds is due to a poor rating from a regional transportation planning agency. It will cost close to $3.8 million to run the streetcar during its first full year of operation, and the project expects to post a $2 million deficit during that time period.

The tennis pros say that the restaurant’s late hours and comfortable atmosphere has them dining at the establishment on multiple occasions gnoshing those baby back ribs.

        <p>If there’s one thing the Catholic Archdiocese are good for is its ability to cause guilt among large groups of people. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati asked principals at local Catholic schools not to encourage students to raise money for the ALS Association through the ice-bucket challenge because the association uses embryonic stem cells in its research. In order to harvest embryonic stem cells, an embryo must be destroyed and many Catholics relate that to abortion, which the Church is strongly against.

        <p>About 10 years ago, the federal government mandated that the Metropolitan Sewer District (aka MSD) perform billions of dollars of upgrades to the city's sewer system. The problem is that even though the city runs MSD, the county is charge of policy & spending and the two entities rarely see eye-to-eye. The latest example of this pissing match is that the county says the city isn't complying with a federal ruling from a few months ago stipulating that the county has the final say. If it sounds like a broken record, thats because it is... sigh.

The long-troubled restaurant owes $61,338 to the State of Ohio, according to an investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer.

Mahogany’s owner, Liz Rogers, said Tuesday’s closure was a misunderstanding and hopes the have the restaurant opened again soon.

        <p>Who needs the 2016 GOP National Convention anyway? Cincinnati is trying to lure the 2016 NAACP national convention as a contrast to Cleveland’s successful bid to host the GOP convention. Cincinnati hosted the NAACP convention in 2008 when both Republican nominee John McCain and Democratic nominee Barack Obama spoke at the event.

The second ordinance puts the money raised from the fines into an anti-prostitution fund that aims to help reduce the number of offenses throughout the city.

The officers shot John Crawford III after he refused to put down what looked like an assault rifle but what later turned out to be a BB gun. Crawford’s family maintains the shooting was not justified and that race was a factor.

The resolution will ask Hamilton County judges to exclude marijuana convictions when considering if a person’s record should be expunged. Cincinnati held an unusually strict law from 2006 - 2010 that classified marijuana convictions as misdemeanors, which was stricter than state law.

        <p>Due to a controversial 2013 law, the region’s last abortion clinic could soon be closed. The law requires abortion clinics to form agreements with private hospitals to transfer patients in case of an emergency. If Planned Parenthood's Elizabeth Campbell Surgical Center doesn’t show proof of a partnership with a hospital it will bring Ohio’s total abortion clinic count down to 8 from 14 when the Republican-sponsored law went into effect.

        <p>Changing federal drone laws and a giant nearby warehouse could make the Cincinnati area one of the first regions to take place in Amazon’s Prime Air delivery service. The company is looking for pilots with five years of experience flying drones to staff up its service.

        <p>The Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) and Cincinnati City Council reached an agreement this week that prohibits any SORTA bus fare money be used to fund streetcar operations. The news is music to Mayor John Cranley’s ears, who has been opposed to the streetcar from the start. Crawley said it would not be fair to subsidize the streetcar with money taken from the Metro bus service.

Linder donated millions to the city’s charities, but also gave a ton of money to a group that passed one of the country’s harshest anti-gay ordinances, Article XII, that restricted laws protecting LGBT residents.

A recent bill requires a police officer to man every camera in order to issue a ticket, effectively banning the cameras. The bill passed the Ohio Senate 24-9 and moves onto the House.

        <p>Do you love your kids enough to wait in the bitter cold for 24 hours so they could go to the school of your choice? More than 100 parents camped out to enroll their children in the Fairview-Clifton German Language School — including one parent who spent 16 days at the head of the line — do. Superintendent Mary Ronan admits the process isn’t perfect, but maintains that a lottery mixed with a first-come-first-serve policy is the best option for children to access magnet schools.

        <p>Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune intends to challenge Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald for the primary seat in this year's gubernatorial race. Portune's move ruffled feathers of some Democrats who claim devoting resources to a primary campaign would hamper their chances of winning the November election. <a href="http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/06/portune-fitzgeralds-commitment-to-blacks-appalling/">Portune also took a stab</a> at Fitzgerald in an email obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer where he claimed Fitzgerald's "lack of connection or commitment to the African American community is both amazing and appalling."

        <p>An uptick in homicides in Over-the-Rhine toward the end of 2013 pushed Cincinnati's homicide rate to 15.5 per 100,000 for last year, which is more than 10 points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000. New Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell and Councilman Christopher Smitherman agreed the majority of the homicides were black-on-black and few were random in nature. Blackwell told City Council the department is "significantly short of police officers."

        <p>Following the loss of a federal grant which accounted for nearly 13% of its budget, Neighborhood Health Inc. was forced to close four clinics in the Greater Cincinnati area at the end of 2013. As a result, nearly 20,000 area patients will be left without access to medical services for at least the first quarter of the year. Among those affected are pregnant women receiving prenatal care and other	 patients suffering from severe conditions such as diabetes and chronic heart problems.

        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals are in the market for a new offensive coordinator after Jay Gruden agreed to a 5-year deal to become the Washington Redskins&rsquo; head coach next season. Gruden has been with Bengals since 2011 and played a key figure in both seasons of HBO&rsquo;s Hard Knocks series that focused on the Bengals in training camp. Gruden&rsquo;s Bengals ranked 10th in total yards per game and sixth in points per game for the 2013 season.

Cranley threatened to replace the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority board after their offer to control the streetcar&rsquo;s operating costs. Cranley might want to look into his powers on that threat since City Council, not the mayor, sets SORTA appointments.

John Kasich&rsquo;s adversaries during this election year. Upon taking office in 2010, Kasich claimed his tax cuts and privatization efforts would create economic growth for Ohio. The Buckeye State has dropped from 34th to 26th nationally in private-sector job growth since January 2010.

        <p>Welcome to 2014, employees! Cincinnati-based retailer Macy&rsquo;s announced in a statement it will be laying off 2,500 employees in an effort to reduce costs and because of other organizational changes. The layoffs should save the mega-retailer about $100 million per year and all those affected by the layoffs will be eligible for severance. Despite the cost-cutting moves, Macy&rsquo;s is planning to add staff to other positions within the company, which should keep its workforce around 175,000.

        <p>Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter was indicted with eight felony charges Friday that carry a maximum prison sentence of 18 years.

The Port Authority was designed to become the main economic-development driver in the region, but a lack of funding has impeded its efforts. Part of the monetary struggles stem from Mayor John Cranley killing the parking privatization plan, which would have given the Port Authority at least $18 million over 30 years. Duke&rsquo;s donation will mainly impact Bond Hill and surrounding neighborhoods.

        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s acting City Manager Scott Stiles announced a big shake up in the city&rsquo;s core leadership positions this week. Most notably City Solicitor John Curp will leave his current position to head up the city&rsquo;s Metropolitan Sewer and Water districts. Some, including councilmembers P.G. Sittenfeld and Chris Seelbach, say the move was retribution from Mayor John Cranley as Curp favored both the parking privatization plan and the streetcar project, both of which Cranley was against. Bill Moller, a city retiree, was hired as the assistant city manager, which allows Moller to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; into pension and a new city salary at $147,000.

It was the first time that exact mixture of drugs has been used for the death penalty in the United States.

        <p>Embattled Hamilton County Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter has entered a plea of 'not guilty' in connection with her recent alleged felonies.

        <p>Good news transit fans, the streetcar project is on budget and schedule per a recent report by project executive John Deatrick.  Also noted recently were estimated consumer pricing for riding said streetcar: $1.75 for two hours and $3.50 for 24 hours. At that price point, officials have projected 3,000 daily commuters but caution that these estimates do not take special events into account.

        <p>Since we clearly don't have enough corporate sponsorship already and the owners of the Bengals franchise haven't bled every possible cent from county taxpayers, the team now wants naming rights for Paul Brown Stadium in exchange for not opposing certain new developments at the Banks. Naming rights can be a big deal and mean big money to professional sports teams, as evidenced by Citigroup's recent $400 million dollar endorsement of the New York Met's ballpark.

        <p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a shortage of controversy surrounding whether or not fracking contaminates drinking water in the media lately. The environmental effects caused by the process of extracting natural gas from shale deposits is the focus of a study currently being conducted by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. The researchers are taking water samples for the Utica Shale region of Carroll County, Ohio, which is about 250 miles northeast of Cincinnati. Since 2010 Ohio has received more than 190 complaints of contaminants in drinking water.

        <p>So Hamilton County needs a new crime lab and the Board of Elections has voiced some need in recent year to relocate, due to space. Could a mutual solution be to move the Board of Elections to the old crime lab space in Mt. Airy? Not so fast, say local democrats. The proposed move could place an undue burden on low-income voters who live downtown and lack the transportation to get out to vote come election time. Making matters worse, the county commissioners need to make a decision on this before the end of the month.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy investigation on the city&rsquo;s rising debt levels, which have increased threefold in the last 20 years.  One of John Cranley&rsquo;s promises when running for mayor was the completion of the Interstate 71 and Martin Luther King interchange project, which the city has already borrowed $20 million to help finish the project. It&rsquo;s of course unfair to blame Cranley for the city&rsquo;s rising debt, but his promises certainly don&rsquo;t help. Cincinnati is carrying an annual $1.1 billion debt, which means the city is paying $118 million per year in debt payments. Carrying debt isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, however, but it could mean bond agencies could downgrade the city&rsquo;s creditworthiness.

In its 95th year, the parade will come south down Elm before hanging a left on Fifth Street to rejoin the normal route that runs alongside Fountain Square. The festivities kick-off at noon with the Redlegs facing the St. Louis Cardinals later that afternoon.

        <p>Despite an annual intake of $92 million, some businesses at The Banks are struggling, according to a detailed investigation by The Cincinnati Enquirer. Those struggling businesses complain that the area is missing key pieces such as a hotel, office tower or grocery store. There's some hope for the businesses, however, with a 291 apartments and 19,000 square-feet of retail space planned for development soon, which will bring the total amount spent by taxpayers to $127.7 million.

        <p>Pro-streetcar advocates are plotting to expand the streetcar's route another mile toward Uptown despite mounting challenges from detractors. A number of challenges, including an important power line to the city that runs underneath Vine Street and an unbudging Mayor John Cranley, threaten derail the plans of connecting Downtown to Uptown. Streetcar supporters maintain that connecting the two key business districts is crucial for the system's long-term success. John Deatrick, who is managing the streetcar project, said he and his team are currently figuring out if completing Uptown route will keep the project on its $128 million budget.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley is looking for five votes on Cincinnati City Council to approve his recommended plan for the city's parking system. Under Cranley's plan the city's Parking Services Department would continue to run the maintenance and operation of the city's meters and garages, according to The Cincinnati Business Courier. The plan calls for about $25	 million in revenue bonds to improve the city's parking systems and expects an eventual return of $7.4 million per year.

If the city decides to opt out of its lease with the Port Authority it will lose a one-time windfall of $85 million and cost taxpayers $1 million to pull out of the lease.

The vote to move the BOE was divided along party lines and decided by Republican Ohio Secretary of State, John Husted. When the office moves in several years it will make Hamilton County the first urban county in Ohio not to have its election offices downtown. Democrats fear the move will restrict early voting for those living downtown without access to a car. It would take roughly two hours by bus to make the round-trip commute from Government Square to the new election offices.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has the votes he needs to set up an Office for Minority Inclusion at City Hall and $175,000 to spend on a consultant to study the city&rsquo;s minority contracting. Both initiatives are a result of the city&rsquo;s poor record of rewarding contracts to minority- and female-owned businesses. Last year the city awarded three percent of contracts to African-American owned businesses, six percent to women-owned businesses and none to Hispanic contractors, according to WVXU.

        <p>The closing of four community health clinics impacting as many as 10,000 children and adults could have been a result of spiteful letter sent by the health department who operated the clinics, according to Mayor John Cranley.

The letter, dated October 14, 2013 and signed by the health department&rsquo;s chief financial officer Joyce Tate, criticized a merger with Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s HealthPoint as a way to prop up the financially struggling Neighborhood Health Centers.

        <p>Following lots of momentum from city council and former Mayor Mark Mallory, the deal to construct a new high-rise apartment complex on the corner of Fourth and Race streets appears to be stalled, if not dead completely. Mayor John Cranley has opposed any further relocation negotiations with Paragon Salons, the remaining tenant who's lease runs through 2017. If the deal does fall through, that will leave the city on the hook for maintenance repairs to Pogue's garage, which will reportedly come in higher than the cost to relocate Paragon.

        <p>Is Cincinnati going less green this year? That seems like a likely scenario, should interim City Manager Scott Stiles get his way. In effort to reduce household costs by roughly $5 over the course of the year, Stiles has decided to buy conventional, fossil-fuel energy over renewable energy via the city's electric aggregation program. This is a disappointing decision as Cincinnati has made some significant strides in reducing greenhouse gases in recent years.

This may come as good news to daily commuters but no one actually knows where the money will come from. Experts have long agreed that tolls are the only way to raise the more than $2 billion dollars it will take to replace the bridge.

The negotiations would most likely include a temporary stop to cost-of-living increases, reduced health benefits and an annual city contribution to the pension fund. Mayor John Cranley says the plan is necessary to deal with the $870 million unfunded pension.

        <p>Hamilton County Township fiscal officer Jackie Terwilleger resigned Friday after an investigation discovered $2 million in mismanaged funds, falsified checks and unauthorized payments. Warren County officials question why no precaution was taken after Terwilleger&rsquo;s books were called into question in 2004 after an auditor warning. A public hearing of the township&rsquo;s finances is scheduled for April 5.

        <p>Yesterday, City Council approved a plan designed to settle the city's looming pension debacle, once and for all. The path forward, advanced by Mayor John Cranley requires the city to negotiate the terms of the settlement in federal court, hopefully including all city employees as part of a mandatory class action lawsuit. The terms of the negotiation will include a cap on cost of living increases and the reduction of health benefits for retirees.

Neuhardt said Kasich&rsquo;s reasoning that cutting the income tax by 8.5 percent would benefit single mothers is &ldquo;despicable and wrong.&rdquo; CityBeat reports that Kasich&rsquo;s previous budget started pushing the state&rsquo;s top tax rate below 5 percent and raising the sales tax, tactics that disproportionately favor the wealthiest citizens. Neuhardt said if the governor was interested in helping single mothers he should do so with meaningful reforms, not tax cuts.

"Seriously. I mean, 3 to 5 (percent) &mdash; wow."

        <p>With opening day just under a week away, Reds fans start 2014 with a bit of anxiety as their team has been plagued with a plethora of off-season injuries. In addition to the injured players the Reds are knee-deep in expensive multiyear deals with Homer Bailey, Brandon Phillips, Jay Bruce and Joey Votto. Four of the Reds pitchers&rsquo; contracts also expire in the next year or two, which means unless big things happen soon the the small-market Reds might face a few years of rebuilding. The Reds open the season at Great American Ballpark next Monday at 4:10 p.m. vs. the Saint Louis Cardinals.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has his sights on turning Burnet Woods into something like New York City&rsquo;s Central Park.

Cranley said Burnet Woods&rsquo; current state is &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an enormous asset that&rsquo;s underutilized.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s plan includes linking the park to the University of Cincinnati campus by use of a pedestrian bridge over Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Despite being on Cranley&rsquo;s wish list, the project wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day until at least 2016.

        <p>It's been a wild ride for the controversial Brent Spence Bridge replacement project. First, Kentucky lawmakers banned the use of tolls on interstate highways running through Kentucky and then voted to strip millions of dollars previously allocated for the construction effort. Both actions served to irk area business leaders but thankfully, the committee has decided to reverse course on the initial funding provision. While the senate will still have to pass the bill for it to become a reality, the reversal has many enthusiasts resting a little easier today.

According to WVXU, there are approximately 100 Sumatran rhinos left so the Cincinnati Zoo has been working tirelessly to develop techniques for breeding them in captivity.

The three-week pause in construction cost the city almost $1 million, which includes more than $637,000 in downtime for contractors. The December delay will add approximately 20 days to the project completion date of April 4, 2016. Passengers are still expected to be able to ride the streetcar in September 2016.

        <p>Smale Riverfront Park continues to rake in the cash. The park just secured a combined total of $12.5 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the City of Cincinnati for improvements and upgrades to the park. The Engineers gave the money to the park to pay for erosion and flooding control along the Ohio River and the city&rsquo;s money will go toward other improvements such as Heekin/PNC Grow Up Great Adventure Playground. The park still needs an additional $5 million to be completed by 2017.

        <p>The class-action lawsuit filed by Fifth Third employees in 2008 regarding massive cuts in employee&rsquo;s retirement accounts was held this week in the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the employees claim Fifth Third executives knew their stock had become risky, but continued to invest in the company stock plan that funds the employees' retirement accounts. Fifth Third stock dropped 75 percent from July 2007 to September 2009, which cost employees tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether or not employees can sue their companies over retirement plan losses.

        <p>Despite the millions being made by Ohio universities from student athletes, Republican lawmakers are determined the athletes don&rsquo;t see a dime. After football players at Northwestern University were granted the right to unionize, Ohio Republicans quickly introduced legislation that would prevent any Ohio college athletes from doing anything similar. The law states that college athletes are not employees and therefore have no right to unionize against their employer.

The resulting suspensions encouraged similar reciprocal suspensions in Ohio, thus preventing him from practicing law in either state for some time.

Under the proposal, parking would be restricted along the route during rush hour on adjacent sides of the street based on the time of day. Opponents of the plan think alternate solutions should be considered as restricting parking could hurt business.

John Kasich and his across-the-board income tax cuts as a cause for the city&rsquo;s decline in public services. Cincinnati has received 50 percent decrease in local government funding during the last two years. In addition to the $12 million cut form the local government fund, Gov. Kasich also repealed the estate tax that played a large part in funding local government. A report from Policy Matters, a non-profit policy research organization, found that state aid to local communities has decreased $1.1 billion since the 2011-12 fiscal year.

        <p>The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&rsquo; and business owners&rsquo; concerns.

According to the plea deal he copped last week, Eaton has admitted to using his university issued credit-card for buying personal items such as groceries and had even accepted thousands of dollars in inappropriate reimbursements from the school. His formal sentencing next month will close a case that first gained regional attention when Eaton was fired in March 2013.

        <p>Slowly but surely Cincinnati&rsquo;s economy is showing signs of being on the up-and-up. Recent news from a report by a local real estate firm shows the local industrial vacancy rate fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The vacancy rate hasn&rsquo;t dropped below 6 percent in seven years, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. A lower vacancy rate means companies are hiring developers to construct new buildings.

        <p>Cincinnati is all abuzz this week about the latest bike-lane dust-up. At issue is a plan from the former city administration to install a protected bike lane on either side of Central Parkway. Following some concerns voiced by business leaders and members of city council, Mayor Cranley decided to re-debate the issue until all misgivings were officially put to bed (again). In short, this delay has not only yielded a new compromise that will cost the city an additional $100,000 but also widened the gap between opposing council factions. If council fails to accept the compromise, the project may be dead entirely.

        <p>A couple weeks ago, in the wake of a report stating that there had been 22 homicides in the first quarter of 2014, Councilman Chris Smitherman made some controversial statements about violent crime within the black community. Those statements have erupted into calls for his replacement as chairman of the Law and Public Safety Committee. Last night, Mayor Cranley rejected those appeals and stood behind Smitherman and the work he's done in that position.

According to Mallory, he missed at least 2 of those sessions due to dealing with sickness in his family.

        <p>The much maligned teacher contract put forth by the Cincinnati Archdiocese won&rsquo;t be changing any time soon. The contract includes a stipulation that prevents employees from supporting issues that run counter to Catholic teaching such as homosexuality, in vitro fertilization, living together outside of wedlock and other positions are not based in the 1800s. According to the superintendent of the Archdiocese fewer than six teachers have refused to sign the contract. The Archdiocese controls 113 schools in 19 counties.

        <p>Now that&rsquo;s a long con. City employee Marc Corsmeier pleaded guilty to stealing nearly $20 thousand in quarters from city parking meters during an 8-year period.

Another city employee noticed coins in the bottom of Corsmeier&rsquo;s gym bag and contacted police who confiscated the gym bag and found the stolen quarters. Corsmeier has been placed on probation for three years and is prevented from working for the public again.

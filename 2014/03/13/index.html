        <p>Cincinnati residents and businesses will soon be able to choose what type of energy they want to receive from the city. The city has been buying 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources such as wind or solar since 2012, but Interim City Manager Scott Stiles recently struck a two-year deal with First Energy Solutions that gave residents the choice of fossil-fuels, which would save them $5.63 per year. Residents now have the choice to select the cheaper option of fossil-fuels if they want to save a few bucks but they run the risk of pissing off Mother Nature.

        <p>  Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley unveiled his solution to fix the city’s $870 million pension problem. Cranley’s fixes include a one-time injection of $100 million into the system and negotiations with retiree’s that stipulate their cost-of-living increases would not exceed three percent simple interest. Stakes are high for figuring out a solution to the plan because the city only has 60 cents for every $1 it owes retirees.

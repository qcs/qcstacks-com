        <p>Following lots of momentum from city council and former Mayor Mark Mallory, the deal to construct a new high-rise apartment complex on the corner of Fourth and Race streets appears to be stalled, if not dead completely. Mayor John Cranley has opposed any further relocation negotiations with Paragon Salons, the remaining tenant who's lease runs through 2017. If the deal does fall through, that will leave the city on the hook for maintenance repairs to Pogue's garage, which will reportedly come in higher than the cost to relocate Paragon.

        <p>Ohio Police have found 315 methamphetamine labs since October 2013, a pace that is set to break the record set in 2009 when 348 were found. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said meth abuse has hit epidemic proportions in the state, most notably in rural areas. Southwest Ohio counties Highland, Clermont and Fairfield are all reporting a jump in meth lab seizures.

        <p>In the wake of yet another winter storm, the Cincinnati Department of Public Services said it was almost $4.7 million over budget this winter. Close to $1 million was spent on overtime for snow plow drivers and maintenance workers while another $2.8 million was spent for extra salt supplies. The county has gone through about 22,000 tons of salt so far this winter.

        <p>In case you hadn't heard, Cincinnati's highest-profile corporate headquarters was the subject of a crazy stunt this week, staged by fearless protesters. Greenpeace activists now stand accused of illicitly gaining access to the global headquarters and unfurling huge banners with catchy slogans targeting some of P&G's products and operations. According to security, the protesters had help in gaining access to the building. Now, much to the chagrin of Greenpeace, everybody's talking about the security implications as opposed to the intended subject: the sustainable sourcing of palm oil.

MSD, the organization responsible for completing the work, wants the ordinance suspended but the council has not yet been able to secure the votes necessary to do so.

The Cincinnati Police Commander for the Business Sector says that while the general perception of safety downtown isn't great, that's not a realistic view.

        <p>Plans are in works to help move Paragon Salons, the tenant who is holding up a $97 million downtown development deal, from Pogue&rsquo;s garage. The developer behind the proposed 30-story, 300-luxury apartment building agreed to step-in and cover some of the salon&rsquo;s relocation and rebuilding costs. Paragon&rsquo;s lease expires in the garage in 2017 and the salon currently employs 36 people and serves close to 500 customers per week. The salon recently filed a lawsuit in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas against the city to allow it to stay in its current location until their lease expires.

        <p>Is Cincinnati going less green this year? That seems like a likely scenario, should interim City Manager Scott Stiles get his way. In effort to reduce household costs by roughly $5 over the course of the year, Stiles has decided to buy conventional, fossil-fuel energy over renewable energy via the city's electric aggregation program. This is a disappointing decision as Cincinnati has made some significant strides in reducing greenhouse gases in recent years.

        <p>Cincinnati residents and businesses will soon be able to choose what type of energy they want to receive from the city. The city has been buying 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources such as wind or solar since 2012, but Interim City Manager Scott Stiles recently struck a two-year deal with First Energy Solutions that gave residents the choice of fossil-fuels, which would save them $5.63 per year. Residents now have the choice to select the cheaper option of fossil-fuels if they want to save a few bucks but they run the risk of pissing off Mother Nature.

Stakes are high for figuring out a solution to the plan because the city only has 60 cents for every $1 it owes retirees.

        <p>The discussion amongst KY lawmakers about what to do with the aging bridge carrying I75 traffic between Ohio and Kentucky continued this week but yielded little progress. While the only consensus is that something must be done, the means to do so was pushed into further limbo as lawmakers voted to ban the use of tolls. This may come as good news to daily commuters but no one actually knows where the money will come from. Experts have long agreed that tolls are the only way to raise the more than $2 billion dollars it will take to replace the bridge.

The EPA is working with the owner and operator of the pipeline to contain the spill and get things cleaned up.

        <p>Hamilton County Township fiscal officer Jackie Terwilleger resigned Friday after an investigation discovered $2 million in mismanaged funds, falsified checks and unauthorized payments. Warren County officials question why no precaution was taken after Terwilleger&rsquo;s books were called into question in 2004 after an auditor warning. A public hearing of the township&rsquo;s finances is scheduled for April 5.

        <p>Yesterday, City Council approved a plan designed to settle the city's looming pension debacle, once and for all. The path forward, advanced by Mayor John Cranley requires the city to negotiate the terms of the settlement in federal court, hopefully including all city employees as part of a mandatory class action lawsuit. The terms of the negotiation will include a cap on cost of living increases and the reduction of health benefits for retirees.

        <p>Cincinnati Red&rsquo;s pitcher Aroldis Chapman took a line drive to the face off the bat of Kansas City Royals&rsquo; catcher Salvador Perez that landed the Reds&rsquo; high-speed southpaw in the hospital with a fracture above his left eye. Chapman never lost consciousness and was able to communicate and move his hands, feet and legs. Reds manager Bryan Price is expected to make an announcement on Chapman&rsquo;s recovery later today.

        <p>Following Monday's decision by KY lawmakers to ban the use of tolls on interstate highways, the state legislature just removed $37 million in funding previously earmarked for the Brent Spence Bridge replacement project. Evidently, lawmakers want the federal government to fund the project since I75 is major transportation artery.

        <p>Ohio Governor John Kasich is recommending $10 million in funding from the Ohio General Assembly for two historic buildings in Cincinnati. While the sum, split between Union Terminal and Music Hall, is only a fraction of what is needed to repair and renovate the two buildings, the show of commitment from state officials is welcomed by local leaders.

        <p>Lt. Governor-candidate Sharon Neuhardt took issue with current-Governor John Kasich&rsquo;s tax-cut proposal saying it further promotes the governor&rsquo;s agenda of helping Ohio&rsquo;s top 1 percent. Neuhardt said Kasich&rsquo;s reasoning that cutting the income tax by 8.5 percent would benefit single mothers is &ldquo;despicable and wrong.&rdquo; CityBeat reports that Kasich&rsquo;s previous budget started pushing the state&rsquo;s top tax rate below 5 percent and raising the sales tax, tactics that disproportionately favor the wealthiest citizens. Neuhardt said if the governor was interested in helping single mothers he should do so with meaningful reforms, not tax cuts.

        <p>Orchestral enthusiasts and Langree fan-folk can now officially rest easy, Lumenocity is returning to Washington Park in early August, 2014. The original ceremony to introduce the new conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra to thousands of excited fans was a resounding success last year, bringing more than 35,000 people into the park over two days. Featuring a projection mapped graphic display set against adjacent, historic Music Hall, the event was the talk of town for months. Be sure to put this on your calendars folks, you don't want to miss it.

        <p>Despite cutting nearly 50 percent of money distributed to the Local Government Fund and eliminating the estate tax - of which 80 percent went to cities and townships - Gov. John Kasich doesn&rsquo;t believe the lack of funding for local governments is his doing. Kasich sat down with an interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer where he scoffed at local governments&rsquo; claims that his cuts would hamper their budgets: "With a 3 to 5 (percent) devastating cut in their Local Government Fund, how could they survive that?" he scoffed. "Seriously. I mean, 3 to 5 (percent) &mdash; wow."

That's Pump Station No. 7 and if you haven't heard, its being converted into Cincinnati's latest beer production facility, Brewery X.

        <p>With opening day just under a week away, Reds fans start 2014 with a bit of anxiety as their team has been plagued with a plethora of off-season injuries. In addition to the injured players the Reds are knee-deep in expensive multiyear deals with Homer Bailey, Brandon Phillips, Jay Bruce and Joey Votto. Four of the Reds pitchers&rsquo; contracts also expire in the next year or two, which means unless big things happen soon the the small-market Reds might face a few years of rebuilding. The Reds open the season at Great American Ballpark next Monday at 4:10 p.m. vs. the Saint Louis Cardinals.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has his sights on turning Burnet Woods into something like New York City&rsquo;s Central Park. Cranley&rsquo;s impetus on rehabbing Burnet Woods is to provide residents of Clifton and Corryville a top-notch public park similar to the renovated Washington Park. Cranley said Burnet Woods&rsquo; current state is &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an enormous asset that&rsquo;s underutilized.&rdquo; The mayor&rsquo;s plan includes linking the park to the University of Cincinnati campus by use of a pedestrian bridge over Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Despite being on Cranley&rsquo;s wish list, the project wouldn&rsquo;t see the light of day until at least 2016.

        <p>It's been a wild ride for the controversial Brent Spence Bridge replacement project. First, Kentucky lawmakers banned the use of tolls on interstate highways running through Kentucky and then voted to strip millions of dollars previously allocated for the construction effort. Both actions served to irk area business leaders but thankfully, the committee has decided to reverse course on the initial funding provision. While the senate will still have to pass the bill for it to become a reality, the reversal has many enthusiasts resting a little easier today.

        <p>Smale Riverfront Park is getting infused with millions of dollars in additional cash to help complete many of the ongoing projects there in preparation for the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In addition to the existing fountains, swings and picturesque river walk, park officials are working on more water features, expanding the river walk to the west of the Roebling bridge, multiple esplanades and playgrounds for the kiddos. Maybe its time for Northern Kentucky to consider upping it's game.

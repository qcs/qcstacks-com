        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s Bockfest kicks off its 22nd year in Over-the-Rhine this weekend replete with goats, a sausage queen and plenty of beer. Organizers are expanding the venue this year by adding a large tent across from Bockfest Hall that will nearly double the size.

        <p>In case you hadn't heard, Cincinnati's highest-profile corporate headquarters was the subject of a crazy stunt this week, staged by fearless protesters. Greenpeace activists now stand accused of illicitly gaining access to the global headquarters and unfurling huge banners with catchy slogans targeting some of P&G's products and operations. According to security, the protesters had help in gaining access to the building. Now, much to the chagrin of Greenpeace, everybody's talking about the security implications as opposed to the intended subject: the sustainable sourcing of palm oil.

        <p>Without no deal on the horizon, the responsible bidder ordinance saga continues. It will take 18 months to complete the federally mandated work on the city's sewer system and unless they get started soon, the city and county could be facing fines of up to $1,000 a day. MSD, the organization responsible for completing the work, wants the ordinance suspended but the council has not yet been able to secure the votes necessary to do so.

        <p>Opponents of gambling and the introduction of new casino's always argue about the implications of crime on the surrounding community, but according to a new report by WVXU, that hasn't been a problem for Horseshoe Casino in it's first year of operation. The Cincinnati Police Commander for the Business Sector says that while the general perception of safety downtown isn't great, that's not a realistic view.

        <p>Plans are in works to help move Paragon Salons, the tenant who is holding up a $97 million downtown development deal, from Pogue&rsquo;s garage. The developer behind the proposed 30-story, 300-luxury apartment building agreed to step-in and cover some of the salon&rsquo;s relocation and rebuilding costs. Paragon&rsquo;s lease expires in the garage in 2017 and the salon currently employs 36 people and serves close to 500 customers per week. The salon recently filed a lawsuit in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas against the city to allow it to stay in its current location until their lease expires.

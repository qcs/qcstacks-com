        <p>Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune intends to challenge Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald for the primary seat in this year's gubernatorial race. Portune's move ruffled feathers of some Democrats who claim devoting resources to a primary campaign would hamper their chances of winning the November election. <a href="http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/06/portune-fitzgeralds-commitment-to-blacks-appalling/">Portune also took a stab</a> at Fitzgerald in an email obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer where he claimed Fitzgerald's "lack of connection or commitment to the African American community is both amazing and appalling."

        <p>An uptick in homicides in Over-the-Rhine toward the end of 2013 pushed Cincinnati's homicide rate to 15.5 per 100,000 for last year, which is more than 10 points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000. New Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell and Councilman Christopher Smitherman agreed the majority of the homicides were black-on-black and few were random in nature. Blackwell told City Council the department is "significantly short of police officers."

        <p>Following the loss of a federal grant which accounted for nearly 13% of its budget, Neighborhood Health Inc. was forced to close four clinics in the Greater Cincinnati area at the end of 2013. As a result, nearly 20,000 area patients will be left without access to medical services for at least the first quarter of the year. Among those affected are pregnant women receiving prenatal care and other	 patients suffering from severe conditions such as diabetes and chronic heart problems.

        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals are in the market for a new offensive coordinator after Jay Gruden agreed to a 5-year deal to become the Washington Redskins&rsquo; head coach next season. Gruden has been with Bengals since 2011 and played a key figure in both seasons of HBO&rsquo;s Hard Knocks series that focused on the Bengals in training camp. Gruden&rsquo;s Bengals ranked 10th in total yards per game and sixth in points per game for the 2013 season.

Cranley threatened to replace the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority board after their offer to control the streetcar&rsquo;s operating costs. Cranley might want to look into his powers on that threat since City Council, not the mayor, sets SORTA appointments.

        <p>A report published in November showed Ohio&rsquo;s unemployment rate above the national average in September and October. This news should bring some firepower to Gov. John Kasich&rsquo;s adversaries during this election year. Upon taking office in 2010, Kasich claimed his tax cuts and privatization efforts would create economic growth for Ohio. The Buckeye State has dropped from 34th to 26th nationally in private-sector job growth since January 2010.

        <p>Welcome to 2014, employees! Cincinnati-based retailer Macy&rsquo;s announced in a statement it will be laying off 2,500 employees in an effort to reduce costs and because of other organizational changes. The layoffs should save the mega-retailer about $100 million per year and all those affected by the layoffs will be eligible for severance. Despite the cost-cutting moves, Macy&rsquo;s is planning to add staff to other positions within the company, which should keep its workforce around 175,000.

        <p>Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter was indicted with eight felony charges Friday that carry a maximum prison sentence of 18 years.

Retired County Juvenile Court Judge Tom Lipps has been appointed to help the court through April 10.

The Port Authority was designed to become the main economic-development driver in the region, but a lack of funding has impeded its efforts. Part of the monetary struggles stem from Mayor John Cranley killing the parking privatization plan, which would have given the Port Authority at least $18 million over 30 years. Duke&rsquo;s donation will mainly impact Bond Hill and surrounding neighborhoods.

        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s acting City Manager Scott Stiles announced a big shake up in the city&rsquo;s core leadership positions this week. Most notably City Solicitor John Curp will leave his current position to head up the city&rsquo;s Metropolitan Sewer and Water districts. Some, including councilmembers P.G. Sittenfeld and Chris Seelbach, say the move was retribution from Mayor John Cranley as Curp favored both the parking privatization plan and the streetcar project, both of which Cranley was against. Bill Moller, a city retiree, was hired as the assistant city manager, which allows Moller to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; into pension and a new city salary at $147,000.

It was the first time that exact mixture of drugs has been used for the death penalty in the United States. The length of the procedure -- which was Ohio&rsquo;s longest since the death penalty returned in 1999 -- prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to ask Gov.

Fewer than ten states nationwide limit the ABV in beer.

        <p>Good news transit fans, the streetcar project is on budget and schedule per a recent report by project executive John Deatrick.  Also noted recently were estimated consumer pricing for riding said streetcar: $1.75 for two hours and $3.50 for 24 hours. At that price point, officials have projected 3,000 daily commuters but caution that these estimates do not take special events into account.

        <p>Since we clearly don't have enough corporate sponsorship already and the owners of the Bengals franchise haven't bled every possible cent from county taxpayers, the team now wants naming rights for Paul Brown Stadium in exchange for not opposing certain new developments at the Banks. Naming rights can be a big deal and mean big money to professional sports teams, as evidenced by Citigroup's recent $400 million dollar endorsement of the New York Met's ballpark.

        <p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a shortage of controversy surrounding whether or not fracking contaminates drinking water in the media lately. The environmental effects caused by the process of extracting natural gas from shale deposits is the focus of a study currently being conducted by researchers at the University of Cincinnati. The researchers are taking water samples for the Utica Shale region of Carroll County, Ohio, which is about 250 miles northeast of Cincinnati. Since 2010 Ohio has received more than 190 complaints of contaminants in drinking water.

        <p>If the Ohio Department of Transportation gets its way a 17-mile rail line would be constructed connecting residents living in Cincinnati&rsquo;s eastern suburbs to downtown. The rail line, currently dubbed the Oasis Line, would be done in four phases, &ldquo;from the Riverfront Transit Center to Montgomery Inn at the Boathouse, from the boathouse to Columbia Tusculum, from Columbia Tusculum to Fairfax/Red Bank Road, from Fairfax/Red Bank to Ancor and from Ancor to Milford,&rdquo; according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. More than 3,200 people are estimated to ride the proposed line daily if it is constructed.

        <p>Just because there aren&rsquo;t many fracking locations near Cincinnati doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t join in on the fun of experimenting with questionable chemicals. The U.S. Coast Guard is deciding as to whether or not to &ldquo;allow oil and gas companies to ship fracking wastewater on barges down the Ohio River,&rdquo; reports WCPO. Those in favor of shipping the chemicals on our mighty Ohio River maintain that transporting the chemical-and-sand-infused byproduct would be a boon to oil and gas companies&rsquo; bottom lines since they could instead send send one barge, which would carry as much waste as 20 trucks.

        <p>So Hamilton County needs a new crime lab and the Board of Elections has voiced some need in recent year to relocate, due to space. Could a mutual solution be to move the Board of Elections to the old crime lab space in Mt. Airy? Not so fast, say local democrats. The proposed move could place an undue burden on low-income voters who live downtown and lack the transportation to get out to vote come election time. Making matters worse, the county commissioners need to make a decision on this before the end of the month.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy investigation on the city&rsquo;s rising debt levels, which have increased threefold in the last 20 years.  One of John Cranley&rsquo;s promises when running for mayor was the completion of the Interstate 71 and Martin Luther King interchange project, which the city has already borrowed $20 million to help finish the project. It&rsquo;s of course unfair to blame Cranley for the city&rsquo;s rising debt, but his promises certainly don&rsquo;t help. Cincinnati is carrying an annual $1.1 billion debt, which means the city is paying $118 million per year in debt payments. Carrying debt isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, however, but it could mean bond agencies could downgrade the city&rsquo;s creditworthiness.

        <p>According to insiders from a closed-door meeting with Kentucky officials last week, the financial solution for replacing the aging Brent Spence bridge must include tolls. Some of the concerns voiced within the meeting spoke to an undo burden being placed on Northern KY communities so the Governor has begun to appeal to local business leaders for their support. And while the recent conversations surrounding the project seem more and more prevalent these days, an actual replacement may not come to fruition for decades.

Higher-income fourth graders fared a bit better, however, with only 48 percent of the group falling below proficiency standards. The report comes on the heels as state officials are trying to implement the Third Grade Reading Gaurantee, which requires most Ohio third-graders to test at or above proficiency before they can advance to the fourth grade.

Western &amp; Southern wanted the Inn moved to complete its development vision for Lytle Park. The $15-million project is expected to be completed by Spring of 2015.

        <p>Greater Cincinnati Water Works is proactively working to protect the city's water supply following a chemical spill <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/more-questions-than-answers-about-impact-of-west-virginia-chemical-spill-on-ohio-river-and-ecology" target="_blank">originating from West Virginia</a>. While WVXU has <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/wv-chemical-spill-not-affecting-local-water-supplyl" target="_blank">recently reported</a> that the contaminants pose no threat to municipal water sources, the move to shut down water intake valves is precautionary and won't last more than a day. Currently, the city has at least 60 hours worth of water in reserve for just such an occasion.

        <p>Juvenile Court Judge Tracie Hunter was indicted with eight felony charges Friday that carry a maximum prison sentence of 18 years. Hunter, who was immediately disqualified without pay by The Ohio Supreme Court, is alleged to have forged and backdated documents and of improperly helping her brother who was fired from juvenile court after punching a teen inmate. Retired County Juvenile Court Judge Tom Lipps has been appointed to help the court through April 10.

        <p>Duke Energy announced it will cut a check to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority <a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20140112/NEWS/301120055/Port-authority-s-2014-show-me-money">after an article published this weekend</a> in The Cincinnati Enquirer documenting the Authority&rsquo;s financial woes. The Port Authority was designed to become the main economic-development driver in the region, but a lack of funding has impeded its efforts. Part of the monetary struggles stem from Mayor John Cranley killing the parking privatization plan, which would have given the Port Authority at least $18 million over 30 years. Duke&rsquo;s donation will mainly impact Bond Hill and surrounding neighborhoods.

        <p>A massive, $4 million dollar mansion in Indian Hill burned to ground on Friday and may have smoldered for <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/indian-hill-fire-blaze-started-an-hour-before-crews-arrived" target="_blank">more than an hour</a> before emergency personnel arrived. The lack of a sprinkler system in the home and other logistics such as a depleted water sources were major contributing factors to the devastation, which has been described as "a total loss". Luckily the occupants were not at home at the time.

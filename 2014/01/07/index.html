        <p>Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune intends to challenge Cuyahoga County Executive Ed Fitzgerald for the primary seat in this year's gubernatorial race. Portune's move ruffled feathers of some Democrats who claim devoting resources to a primary campaign would hamper their chances of winning the November election. <a href="http://cincinnati.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/06/portune-fitzgeralds-commitment-to-blacks-appalling/">Portune also took a stab</a> at Fitzgerald in an email obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer where he claimed Fitzgerald's "lack of connection or commitment to the African American community is both amazing and appalling."

        <p>An uptick in homicides in Over-the-Rhine toward the end of 2013 pushed Cincinnati's homicide rate to 15.5 per 100,000 for last year, which is more than 10 points higher than the national average of 4.7 per 100,000. New Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell and Councilman Christopher Smitherman agreed the majority of the homicides were black-on-black and few were random in nature. Blackwell told City Council the department is "significantly short of police officers."

        <p>Following the loss of a federal grant which accounted for nearly 13% of its budget, Neighborhood Health Inc. was forced to close four clinics in the Greater Cincinnati area at the end of 2013. As a result, nearly 20,000 area patients will be left without access to medical services for at least the first quarter of the year. Among those affected are pregnant women receiving prenatal care and other	 patients suffering from severe conditions such as diabetes and chronic heart problems.

        <p>Despite criticizing the sales tax measure proposed by Hamilton County Commissioners, the board of the Cincinnati Museum Center voted last week to support an increase in sales tax to help pay for Union Terminal’s much-needed repairs. Museum board members initially criticized the removal of Music Hall from the November ballot, which caused a loss of historic tax credits and private donations. The five-year increase in sales tax from 6.75 percent to 7 percent will be on the ballot this November and should raise close to $170 million for the repairs.

        <p>Take a deep breath, Cincinnati. Thanks mostly to fantastic summer weather, the tri-state has just completed the second summer in a row without a smog alert. Joyous officials who normally mark the start and end of the summer season with regional notifications about carpooling and the dispensing of gasoline, are happy to report the positive trend. Wether it will continue is unknown, but some forthcoming regulations can only help the effort.

        <p>If you’ve ever walked along Cincinnati’s Riverfront, you may have come across a curious sculpture situated just below the Purple People bridge. The sculpture known as “Shark Girl”, depicting an innocent young girl with a bizarro shark head, had sat in that position for several years until just recently she was purchased and summarily transported to Buffalo, NY. Poor Shark Girl, we’ll miss you.

The struggling Levee has lost an 3D iMax movie theater, suffered poor retail sales and seen a carousel of revolving tenants come through its doors since it opened. The new investment will contain both permanent and hotel spaces, which should increase traffic to the Levee’s remaining retail tenants.

        <p>As construction on the oh-so-controversial streetcar project steadily continues, Mayor Cranley is floating some new ideas about how to cover the $3.8MM worth of operating costs. In addition to fare revenue, some of his ideas include increasing parking rates for OTR residents, corporate sponsorships and the creation of a special tax district; an idea originally floated by supporters last year.

        <p>An Indiana based gun-control group called Moms Demand Action is ramping up pressure against Kroger for not banning firearms in their stores. The ad campaign, in both print and digital format is making some waves- both for its controversial nature but also some clever messaging. I had no idea ice-cream cones weren’t allowed in the grocery aisles.

        <p>The Bengals have taken a deal with the NFL to remove a local TV blackout if the team sells 85 percent of their home game tickets. The Bengals have sold out their last 10 home games, but due to slow tickets sales this season the team was forced to reduce the TV blackout option to 85 percent. In exchange for making the deal, the team will have give the visiting team a greater percentage of revenue from ticket sales. The Bengals first home game is Sept. 14 against the Atlanta Falcons.

        <p>The landlord who operates the Banks sent the beleaguered Mahogany’s restaurant an eviction letter after the restaurant closed Aug. 26 - 29. The letter from the landlord cited that this wasn’t the first time Mahogany’s has defaulted on its lease, as it has failed to pay its rent on more than one occasion in the past 12 months. The city of Cincinnati has 10 days to save the restaurant by stepping on its behalf to pay back rent and fees. If the city doesn’t step in the restaurant will be forced the close and vacate its location immediately.

        <p>There were more things than just Atlanta Falcons fans&rsquo; hopes falling near Paul Brown Stadium Sunday. Large pieces of concrete and other debris were raining from the underside of the Brent Spence bridge near a parking lot where Bengals fans were tailgating. Thankfully no one was injured, but a 2008 Ford Fusion was heavily damaged thanks to several large pieces of concrete.

        <p>If you’re a trashy citizen, you’ll enjoy this story– Cranley is scrapping the much-maligned, one-garbage-can-per-household rule. According to officials, the Mallory-era rule caused an increase in illegal dumping and needs to go. During the Mayor’s annual State of the City address this evening, he’ll outline several ideas to cleanup the proverbial (and literal) mess.

        <p>Earlier this year, Kroger acquired Harris Teeter Stores, primarily for its online shopping program. As a result, Cincinnati consumers will soon reap the benefits, as the grocery behemoth has just announced plans to rollout the online system here. No word on a date or pricing, but the move should please many who brave the insane Krogering hordes every week.

        <p>Months after raising barricades along sections of McMicken Avenue in Over-the-Rhine to deter prostitution, City Council passed two new ordinances to help curb the city’s growing sex trafficking problems. Councilwoman Yvette Simpson sponsored both the ordinances, the first of which increases fines for prostitution in a motor vehicle from $500 to $100 and another $2500 for each subsequent offense. The second ordinance puts the money raised from the fines into an anti-prostitution fund that aims to help reduce the number of offenses throughout the city.

        <p>The recommendations proposed last week from the Haile/U.S. Bank Foundation partnership to shore up operating costs of the forthcoming Cincinnati streetcar include reducing the fare by .75c to $1. The partnership’s estimates claim that a reduction in the fare would generate 76 percent more rides and only 1 percent less revenue if the fare were at $1.75. Mayor John Cranley said he likes the idea, but has another idea up his sleeve that he has yet to unveil.

        <p>Two local high speed rail advocates pitched the Hamilton County commissioners an idea that would offer a daily high-speed train service from Cincinnati to Chicago. Their idea would be to piggy back off Amtrak’s lackluster service between Chicago and the Queen City by upgrading the infrastructure of the rail lines. Amtrak currently offers service between Chicago and Cincinnati only three times per week compared to multiple daily trips from Chicago to St. Louis.

The resolution will ask Hamilton County judges to exclude marijuana convictions when considering if a person’s record should be expunged. Cincinnati held an unusually strict law from 2006 - 2010 that classified marijuana convictions as misdemeanors, which was stricter than state law.

        <p>Embattled Mahogany’s owner and executive chef Liz Rodgers is threatening to sue the city unless it agrees to forgive her $300,000 loan. At issue is her failure to make timely payments on the loan and keep up with her lease at the Banks. She has stipulated that the development of the Banks didn’t to meet her expectations and she was therefore setup for failure. City officials basically laughed at the idea.

        <p>Close to $3 billion in workers’ wages and $10 billion overall comes from Ohio breweries, according to an industry group. The breweries directly employ or support more than 80,000 jobs across the Buckeye state, making Ohio the sixth-largest brewing employer. But despite the craft beer renaissance, MillersCoors continues to operate the region’s largest brewery in Trenton.

        <p>The oldest fire station in Cincinnati is now home to Walnut Hills&rsquo; newest restaurant, Fireside Pizza. The wood-fired pizzeria is located just blocks from Peebles Corner at 773 E. McMillan Street. The restaurant got its start as a food truck and decided to make the leap into a brick and mortar location after receiving investment from Eli’s Barbecue owners Eli Leisring and Drew Simmons. Fireside is open seven days a week from 11 a.m. - 11 p.m.

        <p>If you happen to be walking or driving along the riverfront before Thursday, you’ll have a chance to view the tallest crane in the country. Like a plot from inception, that crane was built in part by other cranes already on site and will be used over the next couple days to build yet another crane, which will then be used in the construction of GE’s new headquarters. In other Banks news, there’s some hubbub about <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/09/15/banks-hotel-financing-plan-coming-this-fall.html" target="_blank">financial plans</a> to finally bring a hotel to the waterfront development, as well as efforts to raise cash for <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/09/15/devlopers-outline-schedule-for-third-phase-of-the.html" target="_blank">the third phase</a> of construction.

        <p>There were more things than just Atlanta Falcons fans&rsquo; hopes falling near Paul Brown Stadium Sunday. Large pieces of concrete and other debris were raining from the underside of the Brent Spence bridge near a parking lot where Bengals fans were tailgating. Thankfully no one was injured, but a 2008 Ford Fusion was heavily damaged thanks to several large pieces of concrete.

In the end, Portune just waited too long to get into the race, according to WVXU political correspondent Howard Wilkinson. Having started in December, Portune faced Fitzgerald's well-oiled and well-funded campaign, not to mention some steep opposition from the Democratic party who's endorsement already favored Fitzgerald.

        <p>Cincinnati's top budget, finance and pension officials outlined Monday that the city's budget will start out in a $21 million hole. The city expects to raise about $356 million in tax and other revenue, but estimates spending $377 million. This news comes just before the Cincinnati officials plan to meet with bond ratings agencies who determine the city's credit rating. According to WVXU, the city has spent more than it has earned for several years and covered the difference with one-time revenue sources.

        <p>According to Cincinnati Business Courier, the hubbub around City Hall is that Mayor Cranley intends to roll out some new recommendations for the city's parking system and the controversial deal to lease the assets to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority last fall. Cranley has said the City can simply walk away from the deal but hasn't exactly clarified how that would legally come to fruition so this could get interesting.

        <p>Allegations over political motives continue to fly by opponents and proponents of the City's Responsible Bidder Ordinance. Hamilton County Commissioners think the ordinance is unfair and have drawn a line in the sand, as recently as last month, stipulating that any decisions regarding contractors for Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) project are theirs and the City should back-off. The stand-off comes amid looming federal deadlines which threaten steep penalties for not moving forward with projects to rehabilitate the county's aging sewer-system.

        <p>A once controversial tenant of the new Banks development downtown is back in the hot-seat after falling behind on its loan, sales tax and workers compensation payments. According to Mahogany's ownership, business has been good since opening last October but sales were naturally slower during the winter months. Co-owner and Executive Chef Elizabeth Rogers, who has a history of falling behind on financial obligations, sparked the ire of some last year when she secured almost a million dollars in startup financing from the city.

Streetcar supporters maintain that connecting the two key business districts is crucial for the system's long-term success. John Deatrick, who is managing the streetcar project, said he and his team are currently figuring out if completing Uptown route will keep the project on its $128 million budget.

Under Cranley's plan the city's Parking Services Department would continue to run the maintenance and operation of the city's meters and garages, according to The Cincinnati Business Courier. The plan calls for about $25	 million in revenue bonds to improve the city's parking systems and expects an eventual return of $7.4 million per year.

        <p>It looks like Mayor John Cranley's proposed parking plan has enough votes on City Council to pass. Details of the new plan include: increasing downtown enforcement hours until 9 p.m.; upping neighborhood meter rates by 25&ndash;75c; and upgrading all meters to accept credit cards. If the city decides to opt out of its lease with the Port Authority it will lose a one-time windfall of $85 million and cost taxpayers $1 million to pull out of the lease.

        <p>Councilman Smitherman has issued a proposal to resolve the looming pension crisis in Cincinnati. It includes a number of previously voiced suggestions such as freezing cost of living adjustments as well as call for the city to cough-up a one-time $100 million. Once the program is solvent, he'd look to transfer everything to the state retirement system, similar to how other cities in Ohio operate.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has announced that he'll be partnering with Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley to compete for federal funds to attract new manufacturing businesses to the area. There is apparently $1.3 billion up for grabs, and the two city leaders hope to be named among 12 benefactors across the nation. Cranley also noted that whether or not the partnership is a success for this specific initiative, it should help foster future regional relationships to benefit both communities.

        <p>A favored plan amongst gun enthusiasts, the question of whether or not to arm educators to discourage violence in schools is currently being debated in Boone County, KY. The program under consideration, "Protecting Our Students and Teachers" was created by Boone County Constable Joe Kalil following the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Kalil says that arming teachers will deter any future plans for attack; some parents and teachers disagree.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley is adamant about retaining control of the city's parking system. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, Xerox proposed to overhaul the city's parking meters to include smarter technology that would allow customers to pay by their phones. Xerox claims their plan would allow the city to generate $1 million more per year than the current plan, but would require the city to take on more debt to initially implement. Cranley is against having an outside company manage the meters and appears to have support to pass his version of the parking plan.

        <p>A chief economist at PNC Financial group estimated Cincinnati's economy should add more than 10,000 jobs this year. Despite the big number, it's not really all that much to be excited about. The Cincinnati area added somewhere between 8,000 - 9,000 jobs last year, which puts this year's predictions at a 1.5 percent growth rate compared to the national average of 3 percent.

        <p>As construction on the streetcar continues unabated, the opposition is flailing. The latest freak-out? The streetcar will kill you. That's right– drawing from some statistics around the nation from such communities as Portland and Houston, critics of the project are now warning city officials to expect numerous fatalities as a result of motorist and pedestrian accidents. Evidently, looking both ways before crossing the street is no longer an appropriate position for street safety.

        <p>  The Hamilton County Board of Elections is moving from Downtown to Mt. Airy. The vote to move the BOE was divided along party lines and decided by Republican Ohio Secretary of State, John Husted. When the office moves in several years it will make Hamilton County the first urban county in Ohio not to have its election offices downtown. Democrats fear the move will restrict early voting for those living downtown without access to a car. It would take roughly two hours by bus to make the round-trip commute from Government Square to the new election offices.

        <p>Cincinnati's going green in 2014, thanks to renewed effort by the Office of Environment and Sustainability. The group, tasked with leading the municipal government towards  environmental stewardship, recently noted that upcoming projects will build on the advances the city made in solar energy in 2012. With a stated goal of doubling its ability to generate energy from solar power on government buildings by 2020, there's clearly lots to do.

        <p>After a long-fought financial battle the soul-food restaurant Mahogany&rsquo;s will default on its lease at the Banks. The restaurant owes nearly $53,000 in rent and utilities, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. Mahogany&rsquo;s received a $300,000 loan from the city to help with the costs of initial construction. It has not paid the city what it owes for November and December and made a partial payment in January.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has the votes he needs to set up an Office for Minority Inclusion at City Hall and $175,000 to spend on a consultant to study the city&rsquo;s minority contracting. Both initiatives are a result of the city&rsquo;s poor record of rewarding contracts to minority- and female-owned businesses. Last year the city awarded three percent of contracts to African-American owned businesses, six percent to women-owned businesses and none to Hispanic contractors, according to WVXU.

        <p>The closing of four community health clinics impacting as many as 10,000 children and adults could have been a result of spiteful letter sent by the health department who operated the clinics, according to Mayor John Cranley. The letter was sent to federal regulators and may have impacted their decision not to renew funding for the Neighborhood Health Care centers in Walnut Hills, Norwood, Harrison and Downtown. The letter, dated October 14, 2013 and signed by the health department&rsquo;s chief financial officer Joyce Tate, criticized a merger with Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s HealthPoint as a way to prop up the financially struggling Neighborhood Health Centers.

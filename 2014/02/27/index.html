        <p>The mayor and city-council are poised to help local small businesses offer benefits to same-sex couples by expanding the city's domestic partner registry. Spearheaded by Councilman Seelbach, the registry will be funded entirely by application fees and will help Cincinnati achieve a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign "Municipal Equality Index".

        <p>Newport Aquarium is making shark-ray headlines again. In just over a month, all seven recently born pups– the first ever born in captivity, have died. The facility has been working towards the goal of breeding the extremely rare species since it created the Shark Ray Breeding Progam in 2007, so the loss is a disappointing turn.

        <p>Mayor John Cranley has the votes he needs to set up an Office for Minority Inclusion at City Hall and $175,000 to spend on a consultant to study the city&rsquo;s minority contracting. Both initiatives are a result of the city&rsquo;s poor record of rewarding contracts to minority- and female-owned businesses. Last year the city awarded three percent of contracts to African-American owned businesses, six percent to women-owned businesses and none to Hispanic contractors, according to WVXU.

        <p>The closing of four community health clinics impacting as many as 10,000 children and adults could have been a result of spiteful letter sent by the health department who operated the clinics, according to Mayor John Cranley. The letter was sent to federal regulators and may have impacted their decision not to renew funding for the Neighborhood Health Care centers in Walnut Hills, Norwood, Harrison and Downtown. The letter, dated October 14, 2013 and signed by the health department&rsquo;s chief financial officer Joyce Tate, criticized a merger with Northern Kentucky&rsquo;s HealthPoint as a way to prop up the financially struggling Neighborhood Health Centers.

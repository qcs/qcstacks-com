        <p>As construction on the streetcar continues unabated, the opposition is flailing. The latest freak-out? The streetcar will kill you. That's right– drawing from some statistics around the nation from such communities as Portland and Houston, critics of the project are now warning city officials to expect numerous fatalities as a result of motorist and pedestrian accidents. Evidently, looking both ways before crossing the street is no longer an appropriate position for street safety.

        <p>  The Hamilton County Board of Elections is moving from Downtown to Mt. Airy. The vote to move the BOE was divided along party lines and decided by Republican Ohio Secretary of State, John Husted. When the office moves in several years it will make Hamilton County the first urban county in Ohio not to have its election offices downtown. Democrats fear the move will restrict early voting for those living downtown without access to a car. It would take roughly two hours by bus to make the round-trip commute from Government Square to the new election offices.

        <p>Cincinnati's going green in 2014, thanks to renewed effort by the Office of Environment and Sustainability. The group, tasked with leading the municipal government towards  environmental stewardship, recently noted that upcoming projects will build on the advances the city made in solar energy in 2012. With a stated goal of doubling its ability to generate energy from solar power on government buildings by 2020, there's clearly lots to do.

        <p>After a long-fought financial battle the soul-food restaurant Mahogany&rsquo;s will default on its lease at the Banks. The restaurant owes nearly $53,000 in rent and utilities, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. Mahogany&rsquo;s received a $300,000 loan from the city to help with the costs of initial construction. It has not paid the city what it owes for November and December and made a partial payment in January.

        <p>As Cincinnati city planners and transportation officials discuss rehabilitation or replacement of the Western Hills Viaduct, some residents are voicing their desire to include light rail in the plan. WVXU reports that the additional transit lines for rail could add approximately $50 million to the project but would help to connect more than 20% of the city's residents to the urban core.

        <p>Not to be outdone by big brother's recent developments along the river, Covington is looking to up it's game with big plans for KY's most picturesque, waterside real estate. City officials want to transform the south-side of the riverbank into a "waterfront activity center" with walkable trails, recreational pavilions and more under a new project that's being dubbed <a href="http://www.southbankpartners.com/projects/riverfront-commons.aspx" target="blank">Riverfront Commons</a>. The plan calls for development from the Purple People Bridge in Newport to Devou Park in Covington and will hopefully be funded in part by grants from the US Department of Transportation.

        <p>Thanks to regional cooperation, the Greater Cincinnati area was awarded a federal designation this week which should result in better opportunities for regional development efforts. The designation comes due in part to the 'aerospace corridor', the aerial traffic lane which runs between NKY and Dayton, OH and should not only give the region preferential treatment on federal grant applications over the next two years but will also appropriate a federal liaison to help with the complicated process of applying for future grants.

        <p>With more than <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/taste-of-cincinnati-matches-2013-attendance-record" target="blank">half a million people in attendance</a>, the Taste of Cincinnati marked a new record last weekend as foodies and festival goers descended upon the Central Business District for the 36th installment of what has become a delicious Memorial Day tradition. But according to Police Commander Capt. Paul Broxterman, the event was not all brats and cream-puffs. As WCPO writes, there were numerous incidents of assaults and robberies reported around the outskirts, including one incident of rocks being thrown at police officers.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/05/28/temporary-moratorium-on-lethal-injections.html">Ohio Judge Imposes Moratorium on Lethal Injections</a></h2>
        <p>The Columbus Dispatch reports today that a Federal Judge has placed a moratorium on future executions by lethal injection in the state until he can learn more about the new drugs being used. Following last month’s botched execution of Dennis McGuire, in which the inmate was seen visibly gasping and choking, states are scrambling to come up a process to ensure that future efforts do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly since that controversial incident, a number of court challenges have been filed against the state alleging a violation of inmate’s constitutional rights.

        <p>Depsite all the fuss it looks like there&rsquo;s going to be a bike lane on Central Parkway after all. City Council voted Wednesday 5-4 in favor of bike lanes connecting Downtown, Over-the-Rhine, West End, University Heights, Clifton and Northside. The majority of the project's $500,000 price tag will come from funds provided by the Federal Government. Concerns regarding lack of parking spaces for businesses along Central Parkway have been addressed with a modified plan that will save 23 parking space near the Mohawk Building.

        <p>This year, Cincinnati is cracking down on prostitution and human trafficking and there were several visible signs of that effort this week. First there was a notice from Law Enforcement that they would be erecting temporary barricades on McMicken, an urban corridor notorious for solicitation. Secondly, two members of City Council have announced an effort to publicize the names of any convicted johns so as to deter their behavior via public shaming.

        <p>A new Ohio bill will be heading to voters on the heels of the Kentucky Legislature&rsquo;s failure to pass legislation allowing the $2.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge project to begin this year. The bill would allow drivers to pay tolls without having to stop on the bridge by using a remote transponder that tracks how many times regular commuters cross the bridge or by snapping license plate photos of drivers. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the bill would prevent any tolling company to keep the license plate photos past a certain amount of time.

        <p>Before the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1st, the city is required to pass a new budget and Mayor John Cranley has just released his plans to do so. According to the administration, his is the first balanced budget in more than a decade &mdash; that is, for every dollar spent, another dollar is cut. Further, the new budget hasn't proposed any layoffs or raised any taxes and also manages to close a $22MM budget gap. The only catch? It relies on a favorable federal judgement of the current mediation between the City and municipal employees.

        <p>After taking office as Hamilton County Sheriff back in 2013, Jim Neil ordered an audit of his department to help find efficiencies and processes that could be streamlined. The result of that effort has concluded and the HCSO says its key areas of concern are pretty much what you'd expect: staffing, technology, and training. While the report contains praise for the officers it also states that they are resistant to change.

        <p>If you're a politics nerd, you know that mid-term elections are this fall so it should come as no surprise that the persistent war to limit voting eligibility is back on, again. And Ohio, being the swing-state that it is, is one of the hottest battle grounds for this sort of shenanigan, most often perpetrated by right-wing conservatives. In recent years, Secretary of State Jon Husted went to extraordinary lengths to limit early voting hours. And more recently, the dust-up about whether to move the Board of Elections out of downtown has caused a stir among political operatives here at home.

        <p>A state grant will go a long way toward rehabbing the historic Eden Park pump station into a modern-day brewery. The Ohio Controlling Board approved a Clean Ohio Assistance Fund totaling $736,520 to be used to redevelop the location. The brewery will feature an outside beer garden and a tap room. Retired city architect Jack Martin is a leading investor. Plans are to have the brewery up and running by spring of next year.

        <p>City officials and planners are floating the idea of leveraging the Western Hills viaduct for new transit options into downtown. The crumbling bridge, which has been named one of the worst in the country, has been estimated to need at least $240MM in repairs– a huge sum for any cash-strapped city and some see the additional transit corridor as a way to sweeten the deal. Michael Moore, Cincinnati's director of transportation and engineering will present the idea to council's transportation committee next week.

        <p>Nearly $11 million in pharmaceuticals were seized by the Food and Drug Administration from a Cincinnati company because the drugs were either unapproved or misbranded. The bust took place from Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is based in Norwood. The drugs included ear infection drops, hemorrhoid and other inflammatory condition pills, and a skin-rash cream.

        <p>Controversial regulations put in place last year limiting the number of trash cans per household may be changing in the near future. Even still, the regulations seem to have achieved their goal of encouraging more recycling and limiting the number of injuries by public service employees. Despite the successes and compliance by more than 90% of citizens, the city seems poised to relax those requirements.

        <p>The city&rsquo;s proposed budget will not include capital funding that was promised to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Authority that was intended for neighborhood redevelopment efforts. Mayor John Cranley said he personally had no involvement in the decision and that it was Interim City Manager Scott Stile&rsquo;s decision not to include the $6 million. The mayor did propose the Port Authority receive $1 million in annual revenue during the next 30 years by leasing the Fountain Square South Garage to the port.

        <p>On Wednesday, Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce announced that it had selected and hired a new leader, former Secretary of State Trey Grayson. Starting July 1st, Grayson will spearhead the organization's goals of business development and advocacy. Thanks to his political ties to Frankfort and well-respected reputation, the choice seems like a great one according to regional business leaders cited in the press release.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-30282-contract_controversy.html">Protestors Gather Against the Church&rsquo;s Antiquated Contract</a></h2>
        <p>Protesters are expected to gather downtown today to rally against the new teacher contract put forth by the Archdiocese of Cincinnati that prohibits teachers and employees from living in the 21st century. The contact prohibits participating in or supporting gay lifestyles and out of wedlock sexual relationships. The contract came after teacher Carla Dias was awarded more than $170,000 after she was fired because she used artificial insemination. Mike Moroski, the former principal at Purcell Marian, was also fired last year after he wrote on his personal blog that he supported same-sex marriage.

        <p>Cincinnati's rail-based transportation fever continues to grow as Hamilton County Commissioner Todd Portune recently floated an idea of installing a railway between downtown and CVG. The plan to ferry commuters to and from the airport is nothing new, but legislators think they have a viable funding source if they can persuade Congress to allow Airports to invest in capital projects.

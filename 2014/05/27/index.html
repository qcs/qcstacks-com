        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/police-surround-building-near-missing-uc-student-brogan-dulles-apartment">Brogan Dulle’s Body Found</a></h2>
        <p>The search for missing UC student Brogan Dulle ended this morning in heartbreak. His body was found hanging in the empty house next to his apartment complex, which was currently under rehabilitation. Though foul-play has been ruled out by police and his death has been described as a result of self-infliction, many are wondering why a seemingly happy and responsible young man would take off to look for his phone and ultimately decide to commit suicide. One thing's for sure, there are plenty of unanswered questions in this sad-saga.

        <p>Anybody who appreciates good craft beer knows the name Stone Brewing. So it's not surprising that WCPO's latest report about the Escondido based brewery possibly considering Cincinnati as a hub for it's expansion to the East coast has the adult-beverage crowd swooning. If it becomes reality, the latest addition to the city's brew-culture could add 374 jobs and thousands of gallons of flowing, sudsy refreshment. Cheers, indeed!

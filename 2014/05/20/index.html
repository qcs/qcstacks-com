        <p>A state grant will go a long way toward rehabbing the historic Eden Park pump station into a modern-day brewery. The Ohio Controlling Board approved a Clean Ohio Assistance Fund totaling $736,520 to be used to redevelop the location. The brewery will feature an outside beer garden and a tap room. Retired city architect Jack Martin is a leading investor. Plans are to have the brewery up and running by spring of next year.

        <p>City officials and planners are floating the idea of leveraging the Western Hills viaduct for new transit options into downtown. The crumbling bridge, which has been named one of the worst in the country, has been estimated to need at least $240MM in repairs– a huge sum for any cash-strapped city and some see the additional transit corridor as a way to sweeten the deal. Michael Moore, Cincinnati's director of transportation and engineering will present the idea to council's transportation committee next week.

        <p>Nearly $11 million in pharmaceuticals were seized by the Food and Drug Administration from a Cincinnati company because the drugs were either unapproved or misbranded. The bust took place from Masters Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is based in Norwood. The drugs included ear infection drops, hemorrhoid and other inflammatory condition pills, and a skin-rash cream.

        <p>Controversial regulations put in place last year limiting the number of trash cans per household may be changing in the near future. Even still, the regulations seem to have achieved their goal of encouraging more recycling and limiting the number of injuries by public service employees. Despite the successes and compliance by more than 90% of citizens, the city seems poised to relax those requirements.

        <p>The city&rsquo;s proposed budget will not include capital funding that was promised to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Authority that was intended for neighborhood redevelopment efforts. Mayor John Cranley said he personally had no involvement in the decision and that it was Interim City Manager Scott Stile&rsquo;s decision not to include the $6 million. The mayor did propose the Port Authority receive $1 million in annual revenue during the next 30 years by leasing the Fountain Square South Garage to the port.

        <p>Due to a controversial 2013 law, the region’s last abortion clinic could soon be closed. The law requires abortion clinics to form agreements with private hospitals to transfer patients in case of an emergency. If Planned Parenthood's Elizabeth Campbell Surgical Center doesn’t show proof of a partnership with a hospital it will bring Ohio’s total abortion clinic count down to 8 from 14 when the Republican-sponsored law went into effect.

        <p>The 1,500-student School for the Creative and Performing Arts is having a rough year. The latest chapter found troubled school in need of a takeover from the Cincinnati Public School District after SCPA’s fundraising was hit by a Ponzi scheme run by Glen Galemmo. The Ponzi scheme almost forced the school to cancel its fall performance schedule, but an anonymous donation of $265,000 prevented that from happening.

        <p>City Council decided where the city’s $18 million surplus will go with little input from the public, claim three city council members. $3.25 million will go toward unanticipated weather events and another $4 million will help repay neighborhoods that the city borrowed money from in the past. The Cincinnati Enquirer has a detailed breakdown of how the city will allocate the remaining surplus.

        <p>A City Council Committee voted Monday 5-0 for marijuana offenders to expunge those offenses off of their permanent records. The impetus for the decision came from a 2006 city ordinance that criminalized even a small amount of the drug. The  ordinance classified the offense as a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by 30 days in jail and a $250 fine, according to City Beat.

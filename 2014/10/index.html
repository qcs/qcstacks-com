        <p>Cincinnati’s newish Police Chief Harry Blackwell is marking his first anniversary with reports of a reduction in crime and an increase in public input. While Blackwell has been criticized by some for being too formal in his approach to running the department, his emphasis on disenfranchised youth and community outreach seems to have made his first year on the job a success.

        <p>The latest anecdote for citizens of Lincoln Heights and it’s troubled public service departments: thanks to a lack of insurance, police and fire departments are no longer on around-the-clock duty. The revelation follows an earlier report by WCPO  wherein some police officers were alleged to have been abusing their power.

        <p>If Ohio doesn’t pony up and comply with federal law covering Medicaid eligibility for three Hamilton County couples, billions of dollars and health care coverage for more than 2 million Ohioans could be lost. Ohio has until Oct. 6 to show proof of compliance regarding the three couples. If the state fails to show coverage, the U.S. District Court of Southern Ohio would issue an order demanding the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services withhold federal funding of Ohio’s Medicaid program.

        <p>Despite Cincinnati having somewhat of a brewing renaissance, our neighbors in the bluegrass are not seeing as many former breweries raising from their graves. In what looks to be another blow to Kentucky’s brewing heritage, the owners of the old Bavarian Brewery submitted a zoning application to tear the building down. The building recently housed the restaurant Jillian’s and has been vacant since 2006.

        <p>Without any natural enemies and an abundant source of food, expect to see even more stink bugs around your home next year. Fortunately the the bugs don’t bite, but do release a musk that has been likened to pungent cilantro when squashed. Their spray can also permanently stink-up furniture. The USDA estimated the bugs caused more than $35 million in damages to U.S. apple orchards in 2010. The Asian stink bugs most likely came our way aboard a container ship close to 10 years ago.

        <p>As winter weather looms on the horizon, Cincinnati officials are acknowledging only about half their fleet of snow plows are ready to roll. To make matters worse, the city’s salt reserves are about 30% of what they should be as we head into fall. The shortages come as a consequence to record usage last winter, driving up prices and forcing many Ohio municipalities to cut back.

        <p>Due to $5.9 million in increased revenues for the City of Cincinnati and a $7.8 million savings from belt tightening, the city has an estimated $18 million surplus as of June 30. City Manager Harry Black has released a number of recommendations for where he would like to see the city spend the extra money: $4.25 million in emergency weather events; $4 million to repay neighborhoods so they can improve projects such as community centers and parks; $3.3 million in a police and fire department contingency fund. Black’s wish list totals just above $13 million and he said he would put the remainder into the city’s rainy day fund.

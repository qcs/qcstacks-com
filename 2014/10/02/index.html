        <p>Cincinnati’s newish Police Chief Harry Blackwell is marking his first anniversary with reports of a reduction in crime and an increase in public input. While Blackwell has been criticized by some for being too formal in his approach to running the department, his emphasis on disenfranchised youth and community outreach seems to have made his first year on the job a success.

        <p>The latest anecdote for citizens of Lincoln Heights and it’s troubled public service departments: thanks to a lack of insurance, police and fire departments are no longer on around-the-clock duty. The revelation follows an earlier report by WCPO  wherein some police officers were alleged to have been abusing their power.

        <p>If Ohio doesn’t pony up and comply with federal law covering Medicaid eligibility for three Hamilton County couples, billions of dollars and health care coverage for more than 2 million Ohioans could be lost. Ohio has until Oct. 6 to show proof of compliance regarding the three couples. If the state fails to show coverage, the U.S. District Court of Southern Ohio would issue an order demanding the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services withhold federal funding of Ohio’s Medicaid program.

        <p>Despite Cincinnati having somewhat of a brewing renaissance, our neighbors in the bluegrass are not seeing as many former breweries raising from their graves. In what looks to be another blow to Kentucky’s brewing heritage, the owners of the old Bavarian Brewery submitted a zoning application to tear the building down. The building recently housed the restaurant Jillian’s and has been vacant since 2006.

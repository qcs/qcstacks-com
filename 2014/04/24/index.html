        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://wvxu.org/post/city-council-could-decide-fate-central-pkwy-bike-lanes-thursday">Central Parkway Bike Lanes Project Yields New Compromise</a></h2>
        <p>Cincinnati is all abuzz this week about the latest bike-lane dust-up. At issue is a plan from the former city administration to install a protected bike lane on either side of Central Parkway. Following some concerns voiced by business leaders and members of city council, Mayor Cranley decided to re-debate the issue until all misgivings were officially put to bed (again). In short, this delay has not only yielded a new compromise that will cost the city an additional $100,000 but also widened the gap between opposing council factions. If council fails to accept the compromise, the project may be dead entirely.

        <p>A couple weeks ago, in the wake of a report stating that there had been 22 homicides in the first quarter of 2014, Councilman Chris Smitherman made some controversial statements about violent crime within the black community. Those statements have erupted into calls for his replacement as chairman of the Law and Public Safety Committee. Last night, Mayor Cranley rejected those appeals and stood behind Smitherman and the work he's done in that position.

In an extended interview with the website Urbanophile, Cranley talks about the city&rsquo;s history, gay rights, the streetcar and compares Cincinnati to the San Francisco of the Midwest. The entire interview is transcribed on the site, but do yourself a favor and listen to the audio.

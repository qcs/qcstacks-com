        <p>The Banks have a new ally in the Cincinnati Bengals as part of their pitch to attract the new General Electric building and 2,000 jobs that come with it to downtown. If Hamilton County and the Cincinnati Bengals agree on a deal that promises the Bengals  significant upgrades to Paul Brown Stadium if height restrictions are waived for buildings at The Banks. Waiving the height restrictions for the planned GE building might tip the scales in favor for The Banks against Mason and Oakley who are also trying to attract GE to build in their communities.

        <p>Live or work downtown? Then you're probably one of many who have been recently stymied by road or construction work and the resulting traffic on basically every block from the Banks to Clifton. Luckily, the city is aware and is working to help educate commuters on what's up and where everything is taking place. Next week, they're launching a new website, <a href="http://www.roadmapcincy.com" target="_blank">roadmapcincy.com</a>, which should shed some light on how to circumnavigate the congestion... just don't check it while you're driving.

        <p>In response to recent concerns voiced by business leaders and a couple of council members, Mayor John Cranley has directed the Interim City Manager Scott Stiles to not award a contract for the Central Parkway Bike Trail project, which would install bike lines on either side of the thoroughfare at the expense of already limited parking during rush hour. He wants to have a discussion to ensure that everybody's concerns are met properly. This move has project enthusiasts furious, including fellow Councilman Chris Seelbach who claims the decision isn't his to make under the City Charter. Seelbach further contends that this an example of executive action by the mayor in lieu of council direction, the very thing he's been worried about.

        <p>Following his controversial ruling on Monday that stated gay couples, married in other states should be recognized under Ohio state law, Federal Judge Timothy Black has allowed the current ban to remain in place, pending appeal of the case. While his overall position on the matter remains aligned with all other federal cases and recent decisions nationwide, litigation of the controversial laws are destined for the Supreme Court. As a result, the final say in this lengthy battle is a long way off... in the meantime, keep on discriminating Ohio.

        <p>Hamilton County Commissioners are asking a federal judge to intervene in their dispute with the city of Cincinnati regarding hiring and procurement policies for the Metropolitan Sewer District. County Commissioners claim the policies implemented by the city are both illegal and unfair, according to WVXU. The county-owned, city-operated MSD is poised to award more than $3 billion for construction projects within the next decade.

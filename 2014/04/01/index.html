        <p>Sad news from the Zoo this weekend. One of three extremely rare Sumatran rhinos born in 2004 has died due to a (possibly hereditary) iron-storage disease. Given the species status on the endangered list, the loss is being taken particularly hard. According to WVXU, there are approximately 100 Sumatran rhinos left so the Cincinnati Zoo has been working tirelessly to develop techniques for breeding them in captivity.

        <p>The Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Interact for Health, wants you to get out and get active and they're awarding close to half a million dollars to spread the word. In a series of separate, very generous grants of up to $50,000, the organization is helping local communities install and expand their access for parks, hiking trails, community pools and more in effort to promote a healthy lifestyle for citizens across the city.

        <p>Red's Opening Day was yesterday and the parade was a huge success, the game– not so much. The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals for the first game of the season and just couldn't get anything going– in fact, this was the first Opening Day shut-out in more than 60 years! Players and staff were optimistic though. This is the first game of the season so there's lot of opportunity to improve.

        <p>Ride sharing has officially descended upon Cincinnati, and now residents can count on Lyft to provide a transportation alternative to the recently launched Uber service. Like Uber users download an app, plugin in their coordinates and method of payment and a driver will pick you up and ferry you across town for a nominal fee (which is apparently less than a typical cab fare). Lyft says that drivers are rigorously screened and interviewed in-person, so you won't be comprising on safety either.

        <p>CityBeat reports that the broken pipeline in Colerain, which had resulted in an oil spill in the middle of Glen Oak Nature Preserve, has been repaired and is back in operation. More than 20,000 gallons of oil were spilled as a result of the accident and crews will continue cleanup efforts for about another week. The organization responsible for maintenance and repairs plans to replace that section of the pipeline entirely in the near future.

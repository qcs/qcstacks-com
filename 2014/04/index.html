        <p>Sad news from the Zoo this weekend. One of three extremely rare Sumatran rhinos born in 2004 has died due to a (possibly hereditary) iron-storage disease. Given the species status on the endangered list, the loss is being taken particularly hard. According to WVXU, there are approximately 100 Sumatran rhinos left so the Cincinnati Zoo has been working tirelessly to develop techniques for breeding them in captivity.

        <p>The Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, Interact for Health, wants you to get out and get active and they're awarding close to half a million dollars to spread the word. In a series of separate, very generous grants of up to $50,000, the organization is helping local communities install and expand their access for parks, hiking trails, community pools and more in effort to promote a healthy lifestyle for citizens across the city.

        <p>Red's Opening Day was yesterday and the parade was a huge success, the game– not so much. The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals for the first game of the season and just couldn't get anything going– in fact, this was the first Opening Day shut-out in more than 60 years! Players and staff were optimistic though. This is the first game of the season so there's lot of opportunity to improve.

        <p>Ride sharing has officially descended upon Cincinnati, and now residents can count on Lyft to provide a transportation alternative to the recently launched Uber service. Like Uber users download an app, plugin in their coordinates and method of payment and a driver will pick you up and ferry you across town for a nominal fee (which is apparently less than a typical cab fare). Lyft says that drivers are rigorously screened and interviewed in-person, so you won't be comprising on safety either.

        <p>CityBeat reports that the broken pipeline in Colerain, which had resulted in an oil spill in the middle of Glen Oak Nature Preserve, has been repaired and is back in operation. More than 20,000 gallons of oil were spilled as a result of the accident and crews will continue cleanup efforts for about another week. The organization responsible for maintenance and repairs plans to replace that section of the pipeline entirely in the near future.

        <p>For all the hoopla that Mayor John Cranley generated while trying to kill the streetcar in the name of saving the city money, all he did was end up making the project more expensive. The three-week pause in construction cost the city almost $1 million, which includes more than $637,000 in downtime for contractors. The December delay will add approximately 20 days to the project completion date of April 4, 2016. Passengers are still expected to be able to ride the streetcar in September 2016.

        <p>Cincinnati is on the short-list to host the 2016 GOP Convention after making the first round of cuts. Cincinnati will have to compete against Cleveland, Las Vegas, Dallas, Denver and Kansas City for the honors of welcoming thousands of old white males to celebrate other old white males. If Cincinnati were chosen to host the convention, festivities would most likely take place at U.S. Bank Arena. The final decision should be made by the end of the summer.

        <p>In 2008 Ohio established clean energy standards that required utilities to receive a certain amount of their electricity from renewable sources. The amount of energy from renewable sources was to increase year after year. Republicans didn&rsquo;t think this was a good idea and a bill sponsored by Green Township Sen. Bill Seitz is on its way to freeze the standards at current levels, which would cancel any further increases in renewable power usage.

        <p>Smale Riverfront Park continues to rake in the cash. The park just secured a combined total of $12.5 million from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the City of Cincinnati for improvements and upgrades to the park. The Engineers gave the money to the park to pay for erosion and flooding control along the Ohio River and the city&rsquo;s money will go toward other improvements such as Heekin/PNC Grow Up Great Adventure Playground. The park still needs an additional $5 million to be completed by 2017.

        <p>The class-action lawsuit filed by Fifth Third employees in 2008 regarding massive cuts in employee&rsquo;s retirement accounts was held this week in the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the employees claim Fifth Third executives knew their stock had become risky, but continued to invest in the company stock plan that funds the employees' retirement accounts. Fifth Third stock dropped 75 percent from July 2007 to September 2009, which cost employees tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether or not employees can sue their companies over retirement plan losses.

        <p>Despite the millions being made by Ohio universities from student athletes, Republican lawmakers are determined the athletes don&rsquo;t see a dime. After football players at Northwestern University were granted the right to unionize, Ohio Republicans quickly introduced legislation that would prevent any Ohio college athletes from doing anything similar. The law states that college athletes are not employees and therefore have no right to unionize against their employer.

        <p>For all the talk about Cincinnati's prosperity as of late, one recently published report gives the Queen City a pretty negative review when it comes to upward mobility and other measures of financial well-being.  WalletHub.com, which bills itself as the web's best personal finance resource, ranked 150 cities on eight measures designed to predict relative "wallet-wellness". Cincinnati was listed as the fourth worst city. Good times.

        <p>Eric Deters a high-profile and often outspoken regional attorney, has decided to resign from the Kentucky Bar and quit practicing in the commonwealth, a decision that stems from the Bar's, quote, "mission to 'get' me." Deters claims to have tirelessly fought (and won) over 50 complaints against him; complaints that he maintains were baseless and without merit– save four, in which he was found guilty of making misstatements to the court. The resulting suspensions encouraged similar reciprocal suspensions in Ohio, thus preventing him from practicing law in either state for some time.

        <p>$59 million in state funding is at stake when Fairfield and Middletown voters go to the polls May 6 to vote to decide if the districts should upgrade their aging school buildings. If voters reject the tax increase as they did in November, the state funding will be pulled and appropriated to another school district. If the Fairfield levy were approved, annual taxes on a $100,000 home would increase by $91. The Middletown levy, if passed, would increase annual property taxes by $149 for a $100,000 home.

This time, it involves the city's plan to install a cycle track along Central Parkway and the associated parking restrictions that come with it. Under the proposal, parking would be restricted along the route during rush hour on adjacent sides of the street based on the time of day. Opponents of the plan think alternate solutions should be considered as restricting parking could hurt business.

        <p>Cincinnati Democratic leaders including Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld are pointing their fingers at Gov. John Kasich and his across-the-board income tax cuts as a cause for the city&rsquo;s decline in public services. Cincinnati has received 50 percent decrease in local government funding during the last two years. In addition to the $12 million cut form the local government fund, Gov. Kasich also repealed the estate tax that played a large part in funding local government. A report from Policy Matters, a non-profit policy research organization, found that state aid to local communities has decreased $1.1 billion since the 2011-12 fiscal year.

        <p>Following the recent tide of similar judgments around the nation, federal judge Timothy Black has ruled that Ohio's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The highly controversial decision is simply another battle in the long-running war that will most certainly end up on the Supreme Court docket; in fact, Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine is already planning his appeal.

        <p>What was once home to a department store, a presidential re-election campaign headquarters and a host to a number of small businesses, The Hanke Building will reopen its doors soon to an international technology company when Neo moves into the architectural gem. The Over-the-Rhine building was constructed in 1876 and saved in 1995 3-days before demolition by a group dedicated to architectural preservation. It has been recently renovated and is featured on the National Register of Historic Places.

        <p>The Banks have a new ally in the Cincinnati Bengals as part of their pitch to attract the new General Electric building and 2,000 jobs that come with it to downtown. If Hamilton County and the Cincinnati Bengals agree on a deal that promises the Bengals  significant upgrades to Paul Brown Stadium if height restrictions are waived for buildings at The Banks. Waiving the height restrictions for the planned GE building might tip the scales in favor for The Banks against Mason and Oakley who are also trying to attract GE to build in their communities.

        <p>In response to recent concerns voiced by business leaders and a couple of council members, Mayor John Cranley has directed the Interim City Manager Scott Stiles to not award a contract for the Central Parkway Bike Trail project, which would install bike lines on either side of the thoroughfare at the expense of already limited parking during rush hour. He wants to have a discussion to ensure that everybody's concerns are met properly. This move has project enthusiasts furious, including fellow Councilman Chris Seelbach who claims the decision isn't his to make under the City Charter. Seelbach further contends that this an example of executive action by the mayor in lieu of council direction, the very thing he's been worried about.

        <p>We hope no one ever accused Butler County Commissioner Cindy Carpenter of having low self-esteem. The incumbent commissioner recently posted a billboard in Fairfield congratulating herself and her campaign as commissioner despite her primary election being four weeks away.

        <p>The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&rsquo; and business owners&rsquo; concerns.

The vacancy rate hasn&rsquo;t dropped below 6 percent in seven years, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. A lower vacancy rate means companies are hiring developers to construct new buildings.

        <p>Cincinnati is all abuzz this week about the latest bike-lane dust-up. At issue is a plan from the former city administration to install a protected bike lane on either side of Central Parkway. Following some concerns voiced by business leaders and members of city council, Mayor Cranley decided to re-debate the issue until all misgivings were officially put to bed (again). In short, this delay has not only yielded a new compromise that will cost the city an additional $100,000 but also widened the gap between opposing council factions. If council fails to accept the compromise, the project may be dead entirely.

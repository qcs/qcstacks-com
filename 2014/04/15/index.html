        <p>Following the recent tide of similar judgments around the nation, federal judge Timothy Black has ruled that Ohio's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional and unenforceable. The highly controversial decision is simply another battle in the long-running war that will most certainly end up on the Supreme Court docket; in fact, Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine is already planning his appeal. Opponents of gay marriage are now hoping the court will issue a stay on the ruling, pending appeal.

        <p>Federal Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx was in town this week and weighed in on our regional transportation issues. Most notably, he mentioned that there may be an opportunity to collect more federal dollars for the Brent Spence Bridge replacement effort. That project has been mired in state politics as of late, with Kentucky Legislators going so far as to ban the use of tolls on interstate highways. And while that ban was recently vetoed by Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, the plans for how to finance the massive project remain quite unclear.

        <p>As General Electric mulls it decision on where to locate its new office building, a regional turf war is heating up to attract the corporate giant. Among the proposed destinations, Mason and the Banks development downtown are the most vocal,  so far. And though its rumored that the downtown opportunity is currently viewed as the most favorable, many in Mason are vowing to make an offer that cannot be refused. The Banks also comes with its own unique set of complications as Paul Brown Stadium has a contract stipulating no building can be taller than it.

        <p>What was once home to a department store, a presidential re-election campaign headquarters and a host to a number of small businesses, The Hanke Building will reopen its doors soon to an international technology company when Neo moves into the architectural gem. The Over-the-Rhine building was constructed in 1876 and saved in 1995 3-days before demolition by a group dedicated to architectural preservation. It has been recently renovated and is featured on the National Register of Historic Places.

        <p>A 2.2-mile segment of The Ohio River trail will go a long way toward completing the trail project that will ultimately stretch 23 miles from Coney Island to Sayler Park. The new segment runs from Salem Road to Sutton Road along California&rsquo;s riverfront. The section of the trail should be completed by June 2017 and will feature a 12-foot wide asphalt path that will be mixed use for pedestrians and bicyclists.

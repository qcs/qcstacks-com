        <p>We hope no one ever accused Butler County Commissioner Cindy Carpenter of having low self-esteem. The incumbent commissioner recently posted a billboard in Fairfield congratulating herself and her campaign as commissioner despite her primary election being four weeks away. Carpenter insists the billboard wasn&rsquo;t a mistake and is part of a larger message she has planned for her campaign. Ohio Election Commission officials are unsure if the billboard is an election violation and will follow-up with an investigation if a complaint is made.

        <p>The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&rsquo; and business owners&rsquo; concerns.

        <p>Another day in Cincinnati, another up-start brewery in the works. This one is coming to 7th and Pike Street in Covington and is the product of Richard Dubé, former VP of Brewing at Christian Moerlein. He and some fellow craft beer enthusiasts are placing an emphasis on education in hopes to cultivate a higher level of appreciate amongst their consumers. Look for Braxton Brewing's adult beverages to make their debut by the end of the year.

        <p>Former Athletic Director for NKU, Scott Eaton has plead guilty to theft in excess of $300,000 and will spend the next decade in prison. According to the plea deal he copped last week, Eaton has admitted to using his university issued credit-card for buying personal items such as groceries and had even accepted thousands of dollars in inappropriate reimbursements from the school. His formal sentencing next month will close a case that first gained regional attention when Eaton was fired in March 2013.

        <p>Slowly but surely Cincinnati&rsquo;s economy is showing signs of being on the up-and-up. Recent news from a report by a local real estate firm shows the local industrial vacancy rate fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014. The vacancy rate hasn&rsquo;t dropped below 6 percent in seven years, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. A lower vacancy rate means companies are hiring developers to construct new buildings.

        <p>Bob McDonald is Obama's new pick to head up the numerous issues facing the VA.

        <p>Lavomatic Café, a cornerstone of the revitalization movement in OTR has closed. While this turn of events comes with some sadness for its faithful patrons, the writing was on the wall as many diners commonly opted for some of the newer additions to Vine Street's culinary lineup. Moving in to capitalize on the vacancy are the Lanni brothers who are responsible for some of Lavomatic's stiffest competition, the Eagle and Bakersfield. The concept for the new restaurant hasn't been finalized but the duo hopes to open by October.

        <p>A Hamilton County magistrate ordered a Sharonville abortion clinic to shut its doors despite a judge&rsquo;s opinion that the clinic should remain open. The clinic was denied a request for an exemption of a state rule that requires outpatient surgery centers to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital. Since taking office in 2012, Gov. John Kasich has closed 7 of 14 abortion clinics in Ohio.

        <p>Since 1991 homeowners and farmers have slowly felt an increase in their tax dollars being used to fund Ohio&rsquo;s school system. In 2007 close to 70 percent of the money used to support local schools came from homeowners and farmers, a dramatic increase from 46 percent in 1991. The extra burden on homeowners and farmers is a result of phasing out the tax on the tangible personal property of businesses and commercial properties.

Hot on the heels of the recent announcement that GE will be building and housing up to 2,000 employees on the site, a hotel seems like a logical progression for the mixed-use space which continues to grow into a fantastic area for sports fans and business leaders alike.

KZF estimated the trail would connect eight Cincinnati neighborhoods and about 100,000 residents with more than 100 miles of trail.

        <p>When Ohio Gov. John Kasich took office he promised to bring Ohio&rsquo;s budget back in the black. He kept good on that promise as the state ended the first half of the two-year budget with an $800 million surplus. Republicans quickly stashed that money aside, however, to cover the acceleration of the personal income tax in last year&rsquo;s budget, according to WVXU.

This is just one of several similar rulings around the country, which contend that state bans infringe on same-sex couples' equal protection under the US constitution.

        <p>To literally no one's surprise- COAST, the local conservative group virulently opposed to taxes in any shape or form, has announced its plans to fight the proposed quarter percent sales tax increase currently being considered by Hamilton County Commissioners. The increase will go to fund rehabilitations of two of the city's most notable landmarks, Music Hall and Union Terminal. The group's chief argument is that the buildings are owned by the city and thus should not put county taxpayers on the hook for the repairs.

        <p>Kentucky residents should plan to pack additional forms of identification when traveling this fall thanks to upcoming security provisions which may render their state issued IDs unacceptable for such routine activities as air travel. Thanks to legislation passed in 2005, the new regulations are aimed at making it more difficult to obtain fradulent identification. For states like Kentucky, who haven't gotten their act together in the ensuing near-decade, residents may be the ones to suffer the consequences.

        <p>Plans to turn Eden Park&rsquo;s dilapidated, run-down 19th century water pump station into a brewery are on hiatus until City Council and Mayor John Cranley can come together on a deal for the property. Council and Cranley shelved the deal to give the property to its potential owners for $1 and would protect the city from owning the building if the brewery would fail. The owners of the potential brewery hope to get a vote scheduled to move things along on Aug. 6.

        <p>Officials have released details of Brogan Dulle's autopsy report indicating no-foul play was involved in his death. Dulle, the subject of a massive, tri-state missing person's search disappeared last May in a seemingly random and surprising turn of events that ended in a vacant house next to his Clifton apartment building. Family and friends who knew him were stupefied and insisted that he was either kidnapped or murdered. Hopefully, this new detail can provide some closure for the many people who were touched by the story.

        <p>If you saw five parachuters circling around downtown yesterday, you’re not alone. According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, five people parachuted around the downtown skies and landed on top of the parking garage at 4th and Elm close to 10 a.m. Monday. It’s unclear whether or not the parachuters came from a plane or a building, although <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/07/18/meet-the-brandery-class-of-2014.html">a video on Youtube shows parachuters BASE jumping from the Carew Tower</a>.

        <p>Hamilton County officials have received a report indicating that the proposed rehabilitation efforts for the aging Music Hall and Union Terminal buildings were off by about 3 percent. The additional costs are intended for contingencies and additional construction work and are not viewed as a major obstacle by committee members. Meanwhile, the collective head of COAST, the ultra conservative group of hawks opposed to additional taxes and spending, just exploded.

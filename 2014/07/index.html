        <p>Bob McDonald is Obama's new pick to head up the numerous issues facing the VA. And while that's super exciting, some are starting to question what impact this new role will have on the interests he's already involved in here at home. Specifically, his work at Centrifuse and the special task force recently organize the address the preservation and rehabilitation of some of the city's most notable landmarks.

        <p>Lavomatic Café, a cornerstone of the revitalization movement in OTR has closed. While this turn of events comes with some sadness for its faithful patrons, the writing was on the wall as many diners commonly opted for some of the newer additions to Vine Street's culinary lineup. Moving in to capitalize on the vacancy are the Lanni brothers who are responsible for some of Lavomatic's stiffest competition, the Eagle and Bakersfield. The concept for the new restaurant hasn't been finalized but the duo hopes to open by October.

        <p>A Hamilton County magistrate ordered a Sharonville abortion clinic to shut its doors despite a judge&rsquo;s opinion that the clinic should remain open. The clinic was denied a request for an exemption of a state rule that requires outpatient surgery centers to have a transfer agreement with a local hospital. Since taking office in 2012, Gov. John Kasich has closed 7 of 14 abortion clinics in Ohio.

        <p>Since 1991 homeowners and farmers have slowly felt an increase in their tax dollars being used to fund Ohio&rsquo;s school system. In 2007 close to 70 percent of the money used to support local schools came from homeowners and farmers, a dramatic increase from 46 percent in 1991. The extra burden on homeowners and farmers is a result of phasing out the tax on the tangible personal property of businesses and commercial properties.

        <p>The owners of the Rockies Express Pipeline have applied for federal permits to move natural gas originating in Ohio along the Ohio River westward toward Illinois. The application is a result of the possible large fracking business that is starting to take shape in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

        <p>City planners and developers for the Banks project downtown are working hard to bring an upscale hotel to the development space. Hot on the heels of the recent announcement that GE will be building and housing up to 2,000 employees on the site, a hotel seems like a logical progression for the mixed-use space which continues to grow into a fantastic area for sports fans and business leaders alike.

        <p>Local design firm KZF Design released a study on Wasson Way that concluded construction of Wasson Way Trail would cost around $7.5 million for a walking and biking trail and $36 million for a light rail line adjacent to the trail. KZF estimated the trail would connect eight Cincinnati neighborhoods and about 100,000 residents with more than 100 miles of trail.

        <p>When Ohio Gov. John Kasich took office he promised to bring Ohio&rsquo;s budget back in the black. He kept good on that promise as the state ended the first half of the two-year budget with an $800 million surplus. Republicans quickly stashed that money aside, however, to cover the acceleration of the personal income tax in last year&rsquo;s budget, according to WVXU.

Yesterday they announced they had secured the final $1.25 MM in funding they need to complete the project.

        <p>This week the Commonwealth of Kentucky was denied the right to ban same-sex marriages in the state thanks to a ruling passed down by federal judge John G. Heyburn II. This is just one of several similar rulings around the country, which contend that state bans infringe on same-sex couples' equal protection under the US constitution.

        <p>To literally no one's surprise- COAST, the local conservative group virulently opposed to taxes in any shape or form, has announced its plans to fight the proposed quarter percent sales tax increase currently being considered by Hamilton County Commissioners. The increase will go to fund rehabilitations of two of the city's most notable landmarks, Music Hall and Union Terminal. The group's chief argument is that the buildings are owned by the city and thus should not put county taxpayers on the hook for the repairs.

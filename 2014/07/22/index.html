        <p>Officials have released details of Brogan Dulle's autopsy report indicating no-foul play was involved in his death. Dulle, the subject of a massive, tri-state missing person's search disappeared last May in a seemingly random and surprising turn of events that ended in a vacant house next to his Clifton apartment building. Family and friends who knew him were stupefied and insisted that he was either kidnapped or murdered. Hopefully, this new detail can provide some closure for the many people who were touched by the story.

        <p>If you saw five parachuters circling around downtown yesterday, you’re not alone. According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, five people parachuted around the downtown skies and landed on top of the parking garage at 4th and Elm close to 10 a.m. Monday. It’s unclear whether or not the parachuters came from a plane or a building, although <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/07/18/meet-the-brandery-class-of-2014.html">a video on Youtube shows parachuters BASE jumping from the Carew Tower</a>.

        <p>Hamilton County officials have received a report indicating that the proposed rehabilitation efforts for the aging Music Hall and Union Terminal buildings were off by about 3 percent. The additional costs are intended for contingencies and additional construction work and are not viewed as a major obstacle by committee members. Meanwhile, the collective head of COAST, the ultra conservative group of hawks opposed to additional taxes and spending, just exploded.

        <p>A new dramatic mural located in Over-the-Rhine’s Brewery District will help tell the story of Cincinnati’s brewing history when it is completed Aug. 1.

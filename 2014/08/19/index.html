        <p>Close to 5,000 gallons of oil from Duke Energy&rsquo;s W.C. Beckjord Station spilled into the Ohio River near New Richmond Monday morning. The mess will take several days to clean up, according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard closed a 15-mile section of the river near the spill until the oil can be removed. The spill is classified as a “medium-sized” spill as it falls within the range of 1,000 to 10,000 gallons.

        <p>Aside from having his larger-than-life likeness plastered on a wall in OTR, former council member and vice mayor Jim Tarbell has always maintained a pretty visible presence in the downtown community. Most people know him and have met him and if you haven’t, you’ll probably have your chance at any of the dozens of community businesses and events he so frequently attends. For that reason, its not completely out of the realm of possibilities for him to truly shake-up local politics with his recent decision to file as a write-in candidate for Hamilton County Commissioner, opposite Republican incumbent Chris Monzel.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/morning_call/2014/08/streetcar-operation-funding-falls-through.html">Streetcar Loses $5 Million in Federal Funding</a></h2>
        <p>Nobody said this was going to be easy. The Cincinnati Streetcar Project received news that they are not receiving a $5 million federal grant to help pay for operating costs of the project. The loss of the funds is due to a poor rating from a regional transportation planning agency. It will cost close to $3.8 million to run the streetcar during its first full year of operation, and the project expects to post a $2 million deficit during that time period.

        <p>Regional darlings, brothers Nick and Drew Lachey of boy-band and reality TV fame are opening a bar on Walnut Street in OTR and some A&amp;E cameras will be coming along for the ride. While the bar itself should be open sometime this fall, the reality docuseries which plans to capture all the hilarious antics along the way won't premier until next year.

        <p>Sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing better than a quesadilla burger after finishing a grueling tennis match. Or at least that&rsquo;s what a number of professional tennis players are thinking, according to a story by The New York Times detailing how stars playing at the Western & Southern Open in Mason are frequenting an Applebee’s next to the hotel where players are staying. The tennis pros say that the restaurant’s late hours and comfortable atmosphere has them dining at the establishment on multiple occasions gnoshing those baby back ribs.

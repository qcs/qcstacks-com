        <h2><a target="_blank" href="#">Local Radio Host Says Shooting Was Accidental</a></h2>
        <p>By now you've probably heard the reports of a man in Madeira accidentally shooting his wife on Tuesday with a deer hunting rifle. So far, the police and most of those familiar with the story are skeptical of the defense that the incident was simply an accident. It turns out that the couple had been arguing immediately before the incident and there were clothes and medications packed up in his car. Nonetheless, at his arraignment Wednesday, the subject entered a plea of not guilty.

        <p>An area currently under construction at Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati that will house 150 slot machines and other gaming devices could allow smoking when construction is finished. If the Ohio Casino Control Commission approves the proposal, it would make Horseshoe the first of the three Ohio casinos to allow smoking inside. Casinos in Indiana allow smoking on the main gambling floor, and allowing smoking in designated areas should help Horseshoe remain competitive.

        <p>Duke Energy Convention Center is planning a renovation to uncover a unique mosaic created by the late, locally beloved American Modernist painter Charlie Harper. The artwork had been covered up years ago because it didn't fit the contemporary decor. Because of Harper's growing popularity of late and the fact that this piece is much different than his traditional work, the Mayor, City Council and Hamilton County Commissioners are all jumping at the opportunity to unearth the mural.

        <p>Leaders of the Cincinnati Museum Center have an important decision to make whether or not to endorse the sales tax measure that will be placed on the November ballot to raise funds for the ailing Union Terminal. If the leaders accepted the ballot initiative, they said they will continue to work with Music Hall to find a way to help pay for its renovations.

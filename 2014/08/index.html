        <p>Despite a 6-0 vote from City Council to put $10 million toward saving Music Hall and Union Terminal over 25 years, Hamilton County Commissioners might drop Music Hall from this fall's ballot. Commissioner Greg Hartmann said council members need to make a bigger commitment to saving the buildings before commissioners approve a quarter-cent sales tax increase for both. Commissioner Chris Monzel is in favor of booting Music Hall from the ballot as well, saying that Hamilton County only has ties to Union Terminal, home to the Museum Center.

To date, zookeepers haven't been able to determine the sex of the baby due to the mother's attentiveness, constantly holding her new little one close. Born to an eleven year old Western Lowland gorilla named 'Asha', the new addition seems healthy and should be outside to greet visitors in the near future.

        <p>Local health nuts are looking forward to a new, trendy option for quenching their thirst this fall, with the opening of Off the Vine, OTR's first cold-press juice bar. Following suit with other large city juicing outlets, Off the Vine will charge between $8 and $11 for their craft concoctions. Their mission goes beyond just filling thirsty throats; they plan to offer daily regimens for cleansing and local support for learning to live a healthier lifestyle.

        <p>    Despite bringing thousands of people downtown for Lumenocity this past weekend, Music Hall will not be on the tax levy this fall when voters go to the polls to approve a 5-year, .25 percent sales tax increase to save Cincinnati’s landmark buildings. Republican Hamilton County Commissioners decided they would rather let the historic Music Hall slowly fade away than try to renovate the building to last another 100 years. The vote on Union Terminal is expected to raise $170 million over five years to renovate the landmark.

        <p>Now that state legislators from Kentucky and Ohio agree tolls are the only feasible way to finance the Brent Spence replacement project, the next steps are underway to determine what impact tolling could have on daily commuters. Since low-income and minority workers are the most likely to be affected, the Ohio Controlling Board agreed yesterday to fund an $8MM dollar study which will yield recommendations on pricing, logistics and implications on the ensuing related traffic problems the tolls will create.

Cranley previously announced $1.1 million in upfront capital costs to help fund the $2 million plan. The final pricing structure is not finalized yet, but prices should be $75 - $85 for annual memberships and anywhere between $6 - $8 for daily passes.

        <p>By now you've probably heard the reports of a man in Madeira accidentally shooting his wife on Tuesday with a deer hunting rifle. So far, the police and most of those familiar with the story are skeptical of the defense that the incident was simply an accident. It turns out that the couple had been arguing immediately before the incident and there were clothes and medications packed up in his car. Nonetheless, at his arraignment Wednesday, the subject entered a plea of not guilty.

Casinos in Indiana allow smoking on the main gambling floor, and allowing smoking in designated areas should help Horseshoe remain competitive.

        <p>Duke Energy Convention Center is planning a renovation to uncover a unique mosaic created by the late, locally beloved American Modernist painter Charlie Harper.

        <p>Close to 5,000 gallons of oil from Duke Energy&rsquo;s W.C. Beckjord Station spilled into the Ohio River near New Richmond Monday morning. The mess will take several days to clean up, according to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard closed a 15-mile section of the river near the spill until the oil can be removed. The spill is classified as a “medium-sized” spill as it falls within the range of 1,000 to 10,000 gallons.

        <p>Nobody said this was going to be easy. The Cincinnati Streetcar Project received news that they are not receiving a $5 million federal grant to help pay for operating costs of the project. The loss of the funds is due to a poor rating from a regional transportation planning agency. It will cost close to $3.8 million to run the streetcar during its first full year of operation, and the project expects to post a $2 million deficit during that time period.

        <p>If there’s one thing the Catholic Archdiocese are good for is its ability to cause guilt among large groups of people. The Archdiocese of Cincinnati asked principals at local Catholic schools not to encourage students to raise money for the ALS Association through the ice-bucket challenge because the association uses embryonic stem cells in its research. In order to harvest embryonic stem cells, an embryo must be destroyed and many Catholics relate that to abortion, which the Church is strongly against.

        <p>About 10 years ago, the federal government mandated that the Metropolitan Sewer District (aka MSD) perform billions of dollars of upgrades to the city's sewer system. The problem is that even though the city runs MSD, the county is charge of policy & spending and the two entities rarely see eye-to-eye. The latest example of this pissing match is that the county says the city isn't complying with a federal ruling from a few months ago stipulating that the county has the final say. If it sounds like a broken record, thats because it is... sigh.

        <p>Remember that story a few months ago that Saks Fifth Avenue would be relocating from it's downtown location to Kenwood? Well, that deal has fallen through and the folks at Urban Cincy are now wondering what that means for the upscale retailer and whether it will relocate at all.

        <p>Whether they were hoping to avoid a larger initial backlash or if the estimates were off, Duke has upped the official total of gallons of oil spilled into the Ohio River from their W.C. Beckjord Station in New Richmond to somewhere around 9,000 gallons. The original estimate was about 5,000 gallons. The Aug. 18 spill has affected a 15-mile stretch of the Ohio River and crews are continuing to cleanup the energy company&rsquo;s mess.

        <p>As streetcar construction powers forward in OTR and the Central Business District, legislators in Northern Kentucky are starting to wonder if they need some of that sweet light-rail too. The idea for an extension of the streetcar on the south side of the river is nothing new, in fact, some similar proposals more than a decade ago were shelved in lieu of other development efforts.

        <p>A controversial Northern Kentucky theme park that's modeled after Noah's Ark is being criticized for possible discriminatory hiring practices. Last Friday, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State sent a letter to Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear alleging that job applicants for the park must profess their faith in Christianity, a policy which is tantamount to religious discrimination.

        <p>The City of Cincinnati&rsquo;s health insurance program will begin to cover medically &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; transgender procedures beginning next year. The move will make Cincinnati the first city in Ohio to offer these benefits to employees. The move is an attempt to draw a diverse set of workers to the city. The City of Cincinnati also offers same-sex benefits to all city employees.

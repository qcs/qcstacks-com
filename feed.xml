    <summary type="html">Thanks to regional cooperation, the Greater Cincinnati area was awarded a federal designation this week which should result in better opportunities for regional development efforts. The designation comes due in part to the 'aerospace corridor', the aerial traffic lane which runs between NKY and Dayton, OH and should not only give the region preferential treatment on federal grant applications over the next two years but will also appropriate a federal liaison to help with the complicated process of applying for future grants.

The bill would allow drivers to pay tolls without having to stop on the bridge by using a remote transponder that tracks how many times regular commuters cross the bridge or by snapping license plate photos of drivers. According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the bill would prevent any tolling company to keep the license plate photos past a certain amount of time.

    <summary type="html">The decision to add a bike lane to Central Parkway drew more than 200 people to a City Council hearing on Monday and represents two different views of what direction citizens want to take Cincinnati. Bicyclists and business owners voiced their concerns about the $600,000 bike lane project that would connect neighborhoods from Downtown to Northside. The majority of the contract will be paid for by the federal government if city leaders can sign a contract by May 1. Business owners are concerned about losing parking spaces in front of their shops. Michael Moore, the Director of Transportation and Engineering, said a modification of the original plan with additional parking spaces being created would cost the city an additional $110,000, but might assuage both the bicyclists&amp;rsquo; and business owners&amp;rsquo; concerns.

    <summary type="html">$59 million in state funding is at stake when Fairfield and Middletown voters go to the polls May 6 to vote to decide if the districts should upgrade their aging school buildings. If voters reject the tax increase as they did in November, the state funding will be pulled and appropriated to another school district. If the Fairfield levy were approved, annual taxes on a $100,000 home would increase by $91. The Middletown levy, if passed, would increase annual property taxes by $149 for a $100,000 home.

The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals for the first game of the season and just couldn't get anything going– in fact, this was the first Opening Day shut-out in more than 60 years! Players and staff were optimistic though. This is the first game of the season so there's lot of opportunity to improve.

    <content type="html">Ohio Governor John Kasich is recommending $10 million in funding from the Ohio General Assembly for two historic buildings in Cincinnati. While the sum, split between Union Terminal and Music Hall, is only a fraction of what is needed to repair and renovate the two buildings, the show of commitment from state officials is welcomed by local leaders.

While the only consensus is that something must be done, the means to do so was pushed into further limbo as lawmakers voted to ban the use of tolls. This may come as good news to daily commuters but no one actually knows where the money will come from. Experts have long agreed that tolls are the only way to raise the more than $2 billion dollars it will take to replace the bridge.

    <content type="html">After a failed legal battle to remain in Lytle Park, work has begun today on the new location at Mount Auburn for the Anna Louise Inn. The Inn's owner, Cincinnati Union Bethel, lost a 2-year lawsuit with Western &amp;amp; Southern to keep the Inn at Lytle Park, where it has been since 1909. Western &amp;amp; Southern wanted the Inn moved to complete its development vision for Lytle Park. The $15-million project is expected to be completed by Spring of 2015.

Most notably City Solicitor John Curp will leave his current position to head up the city&amp;rsquo;s Metropolitan Sewer and Water districts. Some, including councilmembers P.G. Sittenfeld and Chris Seelbach, say the move was retribution from Mayor John Cranley as Curp favored both the parking privatization plan and the streetcar project, both of which Cranley was against. Bill Moller, a city retiree, was hired as the assistant city manager, which allows Moller to &amp;ldquo;double dip&amp;rdquo; into pension and a new city salary at $147,000.

    <summary type="html">After the brief honeymoon of hopeful City Manager Willie Carden came to an end this week, City Council appointed interim City Manager Scott Stiles Wednesday to the post. But the move didn&amp;rsquo;t come without it&amp;rsquo;s fair share of controversy with some council members concerned with Stiles&amp;rsquo; updated compensation package that raises Stiles&amp;rsquo; annual salary to $240,000. If the city chooses someone other than Stiles to be the permanent city manager, Stiles would be demoted to an assistant city manager with a salary of $180,000, which is $30,000 more than the other assistant city manager. If on the other hand the theoretical permanent city manager relieves Stiles of his duty completely, the city is obligated to pay Stiles some form of salary until 2018, which allows Stiles to collect his full pension payment upon retirement.

    <summary type="html">Cincinnati Museum Center might never have to go back to voters asking for a tax levy if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the constant repairs its home at Union Terminal requires. Unfortunately those repairs to the aging Union Terminal add up quickly and both the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County often quibble about who is on the hook for paying for the fixes. Hamilton County Commissioners told the Museum Center that they won&amp;rsquo;t approve their request for a $15 million per year tax levy until the repairs at Union Terminal are completed. Hamilton County Commissioner Greg Hartmann said the $180 million needed to fully repair Union Terminal needed to be reduced.

    <summary type="html">Speaking of political controversies, the mud-slinging in the mayoral race continues by the day. The latest involves former Councilman candidate John Cranley alleging that his opponent, Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls’ position on the streetcar presents a conflict of interest, since her work as real-estate agent would indirectly benefit from the highly contentious project. Not so, says City Solicitor John Curp and Ohio Ethics Commission Executive Director Paul Nick– Cranley’s attack doesn’t hold water.

Cranley thinks the privatization of the city&amp;rsquo;s parking services was a bad deal, but Qualls thought it was the only way to avoid police and fire layoffs.

        <p>The Requiem Project sued the University of Cincinnati and two corporations Monday with allegations that the university and its partners blocked the nonprofit&rsquo;s renovation efforts. The lawsuit comes on the heels of The Requiem Project being forced to evacuate the historic theater Aug. 3 after its agreement to manage the 102-year-old theater was not renewed earlier this year. The Requiem Project hopes to secure a long-term lease  so that it can finish the renovations which are estimated to cost between $3 to $5 million.

        <p>Despite their many similarities, Cincinnati&rsquo;s two Democratic mayoral candidates have two striking differences: their views on the streetcar and whether or not privatizing the city&rsquo;s parking services was a wise decision. Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls is very much pro-streetcar, while former city council member John Cranley is vocally against the streetcar. Cranley thinks the privatization of the city&rsquo;s parking services was a bad deal, but Qualls thought it was the only way to avoid police and fire layoffs. Their stances on each issue could be the deciding factor of who is elected the city&rsquo;s next mayor. The last time the two candidates were on the ballot together, they nearly matched one another's vote count: 33,775 for Qualls and 33,772 for Cranley.

        <p>Minority and women-owned businesses might soon find an uptick in contracts awarded to them from the city of Cincinnati. City Council unanimously passed a motion to use funds from the parking lease deal to fund a disparity study that would examine whether or not the city should change its contracting policies to award more contracts to minority and women-owned businesses, according to CityBeat. The cost to complete the study is estimated between $500,000 and $1.5 million.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy profile of Steve Leeper, the man who is transforming downtown one neighborhood at a time. The city brought Leeper to the Queen City from Pittsburgh nearly a decade ago to remake the city&rsquo;s urban core. Leeper&rsquo;s tenure as the head of 3CDC hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy, however. Critics claim some of his policies have displaced affordable housing and have neglected historic buildings. Leeper maintains that without 3CDC&rsquo;s efforts the buildings would have fallen into disrepair. Leeper says 3CDC&rsquo;s plans for the next five years include turning close to 100 vacant buildings into offices, apartments, condos and stores in Over-the-Rhine.

        <p>While the developers working in OTR have made some significant strides in revitalizing the ailing downtown community, there has thus far been a large ratio between low-income and market-rate housing options. Cincinnati City Council hopes to change that disparity by allocating funds and tax breaks for low-income developments. The most recent benefactor is a 13-unit apartment building on the 1400 block of Republic Street, just down the street from Washington Park.

        <p>Not to be outdone by other NFL stadiums, the Bengals think time is getting close for an upgrade to their scoreboard. Conditions with the team&rsquo;s lease with Hamilton County call for the Bengals to get a new $10-million high-definition scoreboard installed when at least 14 other NFL teams have similar technology. Hopefully the Bengals don&rsquo;t ask for the scoreboard any time soon, Board of Commissioners President Chris Monzel said the county can&rsquo;t currently afford the $10-million price tag.

        <p>A trolley and a streetcar in Cincinnati? It could be a possibility if Hop on Cincinnati leaders get their way. The group is proposing a $10 &ndash; $15 million trackless trolley that runs from Downtown to Mt. Adams. Funding would come from some federal transportation funds, local governments and corporate sponsors, the group said. The initial plan would be similar to the Southbank Shuttle trolley in Northern Kentucky and would have 20 stops.

The goal of connecting the riverfront to the central business district was laid more than a decade ago when city planners first renovated the area. Some of the ideas that are on the table include a green-space similar to Chicago's Millenium Park or a retail district such as Cap at Union Station in Columbus.

        <p>Cincinnati's aging city pension fund continues to be a nuisance for City Planner Milton Dahoney Jr. Moody's recently downgraded the city's general bonds from AA1 to AA2, which translates to the bond’s ratings being labeled "negative." Moody's said the blame for the downgrade primarily rested on the city's lack of a sustainable future for its pension fund. The downgrade in ratings means the city might have more trouble issuing debt in the future.

City Manager Milton Dahoney Jr. said the data used to generate the memo was out of date and no longer applies to the current parking lease deal.

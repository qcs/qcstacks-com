        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s two mayoral candidates Roxanne Qualls and John Cranley announced Monday that they elevated two African American supporters to new roles in their staffs. Councilman Wendell Young would serve as Vice Mayor if Qualls is elected and Cranley announced that former Cincinnati mayor Dwight Tillery is now co-chair of his campaign. Both Qualls and Cranley are both angling for the key African American vote to win this year. Since Cincinnatians first started electing our mayors in 2001, this will be the first year there is no black candidate on the ballot.

As the new police chief, Blackwell brings experience and a fresh face to the city which has recently struggled with a rise in street crimes. Neighborhood leaders are looking for a smooth and speedy transition and hope that Blackwell will outlast his predecessor, who left within two years of accepting the post.

In an effort further reduce that rate, city officials announced Cradle Cincinnati, a new coalition to educate first-time parents living in areas with unnaturally high rates of infant mortality.

Broadway Square, a $26 million dollar endeavor, will bring both retail and residential properties within walking distance of Horseshoe. According to the developers, the project represents more affordable accommodations than other downtown properties and is expected to cater to casino employees.

The corridor hasn’t been used since 2009 but there are apparently several ideas about what the future may hold for the track, which is currently owned by Norfolk Southern.

        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals officially requested Hamilton County buy the team a new  $10 million scoreboard by the start of the 2014 NFL Stadium. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to the county -- an arrangement in the team’s lease stipulates if new technology such as a scoreboard is installed in at least 14 other NFL teams stadium’s, the county must foot the bill for a similar item if the Bengals request it. It’s unclear where Hamilton County officials will come up with the money for the scoreboard since they barely came up with the funds to balance the stadium fund this year which doesn’t include the scoreboard. If the county refuses to buy the scoreboard, the team could buy it themselves and bill the county for it at a later date.

This time the ultra-conservative group takes aim at Councilman Chris Seelbach, alleging improper use of campaign funds on a recent trip to the nation's capital. Rather than engage in lengthy litigation, the Councilman has agreed to write a personal check for approximately $1,200 to have the suit dismissed. City Solicitor John Curp has responded in a 5-page rebuttal saying the allegations are entirely without merit.

The ACLU takes issue with three of the anti-abortion measures placed on next year’s state budget insisting the amendments have no place on a budget bill. The three amendments include showing a mother the heartbeat of a fetus before performing an abortion, banning public hospitals and abortion clinics from making transfer agreements that are require to keep clinics open and to create a new pregnancy program that moves state funds into private organizations that are banned from mentioning abortion services.

Assuming sale of the property closes as expected, the aging building on the corner of 4th and Race will be transformed into a multi-level parking facility with street level retail space. Retailers have already expressed some interest in the opportunity.

Thankfully level-headedness and common sense prevailed when President Obama and Congress ended the 16-day government shutdown by passing legislation to raise the country&rsquo;s debt ceiling late Wednesday night.

Despite a large conservative delegation and being home to Obama-foe Sen.

So far more than 26,000 have enrolled in coverage through the site and another 50,000 residents have started applications.

        <p>A security guard for Cincinnati based retailer Macy's is claiming that she was subject to weekly arrest quotas and routinely targeted minorities in one of their Manhattan locations. The allegations are the subject of a lawsuit which may be given class-action status soon, and follows similar lawsuits presented against other New York retail outfits.

        <p>When human resources and payroll company Paycor was looking to make the move from Cincinnati to Norwood in 2012, Cincinnati-Mayoral Candidate John Cranley was there to help finalize the deal. Cranley was working as a lobbyist for Keating, Muething &amp; Klekamp, the law firm who helped Paycor gain tax incentives to relocate to Norwood. Cranley's campaign manager said the candidate was simply doing his job at the time and was only doing what his client asked. Three weeks after the Norwood City Council approved Paycor's move on Oct. 23, 2013, Cranley announced his candidacy for mayor.

        <p>In his final State of City speech, Mayor Mark Mallory capped off his second term with a proposal to build a new bridge to Kentucky from the West Side. As part of that effort, he threw out a lot of related ideas, including community farming, easy access to CVG and an entertainment zone that would allow residents to watch movies against a waterfall. The Cincinnati Business Courier has video of the speech.

        <p>Despite a recommendation from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport's oversight board to revamp travel policies and expenses for board members, airport chairman and vice chairman are currently on a trip to Italy totaling at least $20,000, according to the Enquirer. The six-month-old recommendation said CVG's travel policies were not in line with other airports around the country. The airport board is setup as a public agency and is considered a governmental agency. In addition to the Italy trip, The Enquirer has a lengthy list of documents detailing other spending habits of the board on its website.

        <p>The first televised debate in Cincinnati's highly-anticipated mayoral election took place Tuesday night at the Freedom Center downtown. Overall, the forum was pretty uneventful as both candidates Cranley and Qualls have each levied very public criticism over major issues for months now. The general election for Hamilton County will take place on Tuesday, November 5th– who are you planning to vote for?

        <p>In an interesting thread during this year's election cycle, The Hamilton County Board of Elections commenced a hearing this week on the voter eligibility of Randy Simes, a local blogger who submitted an absentee ballot for the upcoming mayoral race. According to the complaint filed by the Ohio Voter Integrity Project, Simes who operates the UrbanCincy blog, has made social media references to living in Chicago at the time he submitted the ballot. Also complicating the matter, Simes has since moved to South Korea on work assignment.

        <p>Cincinnati will receive $7 million less than originally projected as part of their parking lease deal with the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority. According to Cincinnati City Manager Milton Dohoney the loss in revenue is due to rising interest rates. In <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/port-authority-releases-details-parking-lease-0" target="_blank">related news</a>, the Port Authority released the details of their plan, which will include a 10-year deal with Xerox to operate and maintain 4,900 meters in Cincinnati.

        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union is suing the State of Ohio to combat Gov. John Kasich’s relentless attacks on abortion clinics and public hospitals who perform abortions. The ACLU takes issue with three of the anti-abortion measures placed on next year’s state budget insisting the amendments have no place on a budget bill. The three amendments include showing a mother the heartbeat of a fetus before performing an abortion, banning public hospitals and abortion clinics from making transfer agreements that are require to keep clinics open and to create a new pregnancy program that moves state funds into private organizations that are banned from mentioning abortion services.

        <p>Come next September Cincinnati will have its own Food and Wine Festival. At least that’s the hope of former dining editor for Cincinnati Magazine Dana Covrett and her partners. The group is hoping to have the festival Sept. 12 and 13 at Washington Park. A gaggle of executive chefs -- including Jean-Robert de Cavel -- are helping the group plan the festival, which will feature a large tasting tent with an emphasis on Cincinnati’s pork heritage, as well as education events and book signings.

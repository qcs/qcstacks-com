        <p>We all knew Kentucky was known for their bourbon, but who knew Ohio's neighboring state could outbuild a website better than everyone else? Despite a large conservative delegation and being home to Obama-foe Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Bluegrass State has been cited by multiple sources as being the best marketplaces for the Affordable Care Act. Gov. Steve Beshear decided to forgo the federal HealthCare.gov site and build a <a href="https://kyenroll.ky.gov/">website</a> for the state’s residents instead. So far more than 26,000 have enrolled in coverage through the site and another 50,000 residents have started applications.

        <p>In a move that shouldn't surprise anyone, The Enquirer has endorsed COAST-favorite John Cranley to be Cincinnati's next mayor. The Enquirer mentions Cranley’s "creativity" as a vital resources for Cincinnati to move forward. The paper has a long history of endorsing conservative-leaning candidates, including endorsing John McCain in the 2008 Presidential Election.

        <p>Despite being a highly local issue, most of the financing for the ballot initiative that would semi-privatize Cincinnati's pension system has been funded by out-of-town tea party groups. Issue 4 has received more than $231,000, of which $209,500 came from groups in West Chester and elsewhere.

        <p>The drama regarding whether or not <a href="http://urbancincy.com">UrbanCincy.com</a> blogger Randy Simes is eligible to vote continues to play out in court. A lawsuit filed Oct. 23 and spearheaded by COAST-friendly attorney Curt Hartman claims Simes isn't able to vote because he currently lives in South Korea and had previously resided in Chicago before his move overseas. Despite the late filing of the lawsuit, Hartman expects a ruling before Nov. 5 voting day. Every vote matters, people.

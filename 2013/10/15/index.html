        <p>More than 3,000 Cincinnati voters who voted early will receive new ballots in the mail after an Ohio Supreme Court decision forced a wording change on Issue 4, the charter amendment aimed to semi-privatize Cincinnati&rsquo;s public pension program. And if that&rsquo;s not enough voter drama, this year&rsquo;s elections could be the <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/cincinnati-headed-lowest-turnout-ever">lowest turnout for a Cincinnati election in history</a>. The low turnout is due to a lack of a polarizing state-wide issue such as 2011&rsquo;s Senate Bill 5, the bill concerned with limiting collective bargaining between unions and their employers.

        <p>If you've been down Elm street lately, you've no doubt run into the massive construction project taking place just north of 12th street, in front of Music Hall. The work is some of the first visible developments of the street car installation, whose initial tracks will be laid today. The project continues to be a hot topic of controversy for mayoral candidates, but shows no signs of slowing as we move closer to the pivotal race next month.

        <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if there was an app that coordinated Metro bus routes with child-care clinics with open seats for parents with hectic schedules? Well there might be one soon. Local developer Erin Kidwell recently launched OpenDataCincy with the aim for public organizations across the Cincinnati area to release their data sets to local developers to create applications such as the Metro and child-care app. The program is currently looking for more data sets and is collaborating with City Government to release more public data in a friendlier form for developers. Check out the project at <a href="http://www.opendatacincy.org/">OpenDataCincy</a> to get involved.

        <p>The plan for what to do with Tower Place is moving forward with developers hoping to start construction before the end of the year. Assuming sale of the property closes as expected, the aging building on the corner of 4th and Race will be transformed into a multi-level parking facility with street level retail space. Retailers have already expressed some interest in the opportunity.

        <p>Who knew things could get so heated at a nail salon? According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, Chanh Luong, owner of the Escape Nail Spa in Hyde Park, was threatened and then beaten by his competitor John Nguyen who owns the Ambiance spa group. The incident occurred April 1 when Nguyen entered Escape Nail Spa and threatened Luong to remove a promotion or else. Within moments of refusing Nguyen and three of his employees punched Luong, broke a chair and swept bottles and equipment from a counter inside Escape. Nguyen was thrown in jail for 10 days and paid Luong&rsquo;s $8,000 hospital bill.

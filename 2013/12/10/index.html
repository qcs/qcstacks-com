        <p>Even though it's been officially paused for review, the streetcar debate continues to rage in QueenCity with both sides refusing to budge on their positions. In the latest news, the Federal Transit Administration is pissed and has notified the administration as such in a curtly worded rebuke of the latest political developments. If the city doesn't get it's act together by the 19th, they government wants its money back and will immediately pursue collection. Meanwhile, <a href="http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/blog-5334-cranley_might_veto_ordinance_continuing_streetcar_project.html" target="_blank">Mayor Cranley is playing hardball</a> and supporters are taking the issue to streets (no pun intended) by announcing a <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/streetcar-supporters-aim-ballot-issue" target="_blank">new petition drive</a> to force a public referendum. And in related news, the spotlight on Cincinnati's efforts to hurry-up-and-wait on the streetcar continue to gain <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-12-09/group-trying-to-save-cincinnati-streetcar" target="_blank">national attention</a>.

        <p>The patriarch of the Mallory political dynasty, William Mallory Sr., died Tuesday morning at the age of 82. Mallory grew up in the West End and was raised by his working-class parents before being elected to the Ohio House in 1966 and staying in the seat for 28 years. Mallory&rsquo;s sons said their father instilled in them a sense of civic duty as all five contributed to their father&rsquo;s political successes. One of Mallory&rsquo;s biggest achievements was a lawsuit that struck-down the at-large voting system, which diluted black voting power and prevented blacks from becoming elected judges.

        <p>That didn&rsquo;t last long. John Cranley&rsquo;s choice for City Manager Willie Carden, the director of the Cincinnati Parks Department, withdrew his nomination Friday after criticism that Carden lives outside of city limits. In addition to residency concerns, the Cincinnati Enquirer uncovered an ethics probe that found Carden took pay from the private Parks Foundation and the city. Interim Acting City Manager Scott Stiles will continue to serve in the role until the Cranley administration concludes their search for a permanent replacement.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://wvxu.org/post/no-surprise-staffing-problems-cincy-police-and-fire">Understaffed Police and Fire Departments Struggle to Maintain Services</a></h2>
        <p>Cincinnati Police and Fire Departments&rsquo; staffing problems are beginning to take their toll on much-needed services around the city. Police Chief Jeffrey Blackwell said the department is 200 officers short of its peak of a few years ago, which means it takes officers longer to respond to 911 calls and could possibly change the way the department polices the city. The fire department is 20 people below their minimum number of daily firefighters, which forces fire stations around the city to temporarily shutdown certain trucks and other pieces of equipment at stations that are not properly staffed.

        <p>Cincinnati&rsquo;s Horseshoe Casino&rsquo;s revenue has fallen more than 11 percent since September, and 3.3 percent since October, according to reported profits from the casino. But don&rsquo;t feel too bad for the gambling powerhouse: they still managed to rake in more than $17.5 million in November alone. So far all of Ohio&rsquo;s casinos have earned $758 million this year.

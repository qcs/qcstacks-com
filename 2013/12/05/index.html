        <p>The long battle over whether or not Cincinnati would get a streetcar seemed to come to a conclusion yesterday with City Council voting to pause development on the project until a financial audit determines if it makes sense to complete the first phase of development. The past week has been wrought with political drama with <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/morning_call/2013/12/does-a-1930-court-case-mean-cincinnati.html">leaked documents</a>, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/12/02/foundation-may-yank-music-hall-park.html">independent donors  offering money</a> and a <a href="http://citybeat.com/cincinnati/blog-5326-watch_pg_sittenfeld_pwn_john_cranley.html">showdown between newly elected Mayor John Cranley and Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld</a>. Supporters of the streetcar continue to remain hopeful, however, and will continue to keep fighting for the project after the audit is completed within 2-to-4 weeks.

        <p>Anybody that has accidentally butt-dialed someone knows that it can be extremely embarrassing, depending upon who's being called and the potential content of what can be overheard on the line. In some cases, it can also be the subject of a federal lawsuit.  Such is the case of a lawsuit filed against an assistant to the CEO of CVG, who allegedly overheard a conversation between board members discussing the demotion of her boss, embattled CEO Candace McGraw.

        <p>Developments continue to pop-up alongside the Ohio river and now Dayton, KY is getting into the action.

        <p>The owners of the old Enquirer building on Vine street in downtown are moving forward with a plan to convert the vacant building into two hotels, a Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites. The $27 million dollar effort will cater to both business and extended-stay clientele in search of downtown lodging just off Fountain Square. Immediate efforts are underway to get construction moving; customers could be relaxing in the new suites as early as 2015.

        <p>Hope you enjoyed these past few 60-degree days while they lasted, because this weekend is about to get a whole lot more like winter. An estimated 3 - 6 inches of snow and ice is expected to hit the area Friday. Saturday&rsquo;s high is going to top at only 26 degrees and a low of 16 degrees with a wind chill making it seem like it is in the single digits. There&rsquo;s a possibility of another round of snow and freezing rain Sunday morning. Looks like it&rsquo;s a good weekend to stay indoors and trim the tree.

This comes in contrast to previous years when these riders were allowed to board after just a short period of time. Parents are pissed.

        <p>Do you often find yourself short of ammo after firing 31 rounds from a semi-automatic weapon? If so, you might be in luck. State Rep. John Becker of Union Township introduced a bill in the Ohio House that changes the definition of semi-automatic firearms to no longer qualify them as automatic firearms, therefore skirting the law of a magazine holding a maximum of 31 rounds of ammunition. Proponents of the bill say stopping to reload after 31 shots takes too much time. To put things in perspective: Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter, had several 30-round magazines.

        <p>As the on-going struggle to resolve the national health-care crisis continues, a majority of Ohioans have reported support for an expansion of Medicaid in the state. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, states are now obligated to comply with the expansion to the tune of 10 percent of the cost after the first three years. Conservative state legislators have signaled some concern over the long-term viability of federal support and have thus far been reluctant to embrace the expansion.

        <p>After years of controversy including two failed ballot initiatives to cancel the project, the City announced the Cincinnati streetcar is set to open Sept. 15, 2016. An additional $500,000 was requested by the contractor, which was easily covered by the City’s $10 million contingency fund. The total cost for the project is just above $130 million.

        <p>Just under 10 percent of Cincinnati’s city contracts in  2012 went to minority- or women-owned businesses.

        <p>Cincinnati's aging city pension fund continues to be a nuisance for City Planner Milton Dahoney Jr. Moody's recently downgraded the city's general bonds from AA1 to AA2, which translates to the bond’s ratings being labeled "negative." Moody's said the blame for the downgrade primarily rested on the city's lack of a sustainable future for its pension fund. The downgrade in ratings means the city might have more trouble issuing debt in the future.

        <p>In 2015, Great American Ballpark will host the All-Star baseball game and necessary improvements to the stadium could leave taxpayers on the hook for nearly $5 million dollars. While the event is certain to bring some positive economic benefit, the impact on taxpayers has some crying foul.

        <p>The Requiem Project sued the University of Cincinnati and two corporations Monday with allegations that the university and its partners blocked the nonprofit&rsquo;s renovation efforts. The lawsuit comes on the heels of The Requiem Project being forced to evacuate the historic theater Aug. 3 after its agreement to manage the 102-year-old theater was not renewed earlier this year. The Requiem Project hopes to secure a long-term lease  so that it can finish the renovations which are estimated to cost between $3 to $5 million.

        <p>Despite their many similarities, Cincinnati&rsquo;s two Democratic mayoral candidates have two striking differences: their views on the streetcar and whether or not privatizing the city&rsquo;s parking services was a wise decision. Vice Mayor Roxanne Qualls is very much pro-streetcar, while former city council member John Cranley is vocally against the streetcar. Cranley thinks the privatization of the city&rsquo;s parking services was a bad deal, but Qualls thought it was the only way to avoid police and fire layoffs. Their stances on each issue could be the deciding factor of who is elected the city&rsquo;s next mayor. The last time the two candidates were on the ballot together, they nearly matched one another's vote count: 33,775 for Qualls and 33,772 for Cranley.

        <p>Minority and women-owned businesses might soon find an uptick in contracts awarded to them from the city of Cincinnati. City Council unanimously passed a motion to use funds from the parking lease deal to fund a disparity study that would examine whether or not the city should change its contracting policies to award more contracts to minority and women-owned businesses, according to CityBeat. The cost to complete the study is estimated between $500,000 and $1.5 million.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer published a lengthy profile of Steve Leeper, the man who is transforming downtown one neighborhood at a time. The city brought Leeper to the Queen City from Pittsburgh nearly a decade ago to remake the city&rsquo;s urban core. Leeper&rsquo;s tenure as the head of 3CDC hasn&rsquo;t been without controversy, however. Critics claim some of his policies have displaced affordable housing and have neglected historic buildings. Leeper maintains that without 3CDC&rsquo;s efforts the buildings would have fallen into disrepair. Leeper says 3CDC&rsquo;s plans for the next five years include turning close to 100 vacant buildings into offices, apartments, condos and stores in Over-the-Rhine.

Conditions with the team&rsquo;s lease with Hamilton County call for the Bengals to get a new $10-million high-definition scoreboard installed when at least 14 other NFL teams have similar technology. Hopefully the Bengals don&rsquo;t ask for the scoreboard any time soon, Board of Commissioners President Chris Monzel said the county can&rsquo;t currently afford the $10-million price tag.

        <p>A trolley and a streetcar in Cincinnati? It could be a possibility if Hop on Cincinnati leaders get their way. The group is proposing a $10 &ndash; $15 million trackless trolley that runs from Downtown to Mt. Adams. Funding would come from some federal transportation funds, local governments and corporate sponsors, the group said. The initial plan would be similar to the Southbank Shuttle trolley in Northern Kentucky and would have 20 stops.

        <p>A Kentucky House and Senate Committee on Health and Welfare was the scene Wednesday of a raucous hearing on medical marijuana with advocates proposing a state law to allow the substance to be used for medical purposes. Supporters of the the measure say it&rsquo;s less addicting than prescription painkillers such as Oxycodone. Despite skepticism of the proposed law, Sen. Perry Clark, a Louisville Democrat, plans to file the measure in 2014.

The move, which will take place by the end of 2013, will bring over 100 jobs into the city center. In related news, Governor John Kasich has <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/09/09/why-did-state-of-ohio-say-no-to-pure.html">vetoed some tax-incentives</a> enticing the move, but the company seems undeterred.

        <p>Bolstered by increasing cell-phone thefts over the past few years, City Councilman Chris Seelbach is calling for increased regulation of after-market cell-phone sales in the city. The goal is to make dealers who regularly buy and sell used phones register with the city and keep track of all related transactions. Seelbach introduced legislation aimed at the effort last week in partnership with the Cincinnati Police Department.

        <p>Cincinnatians looking for a job might want to focus their search on information technology as the Business Courier reports as many as 10,000 unfilled Cincinnati-area jobs could be available as soon as 2020. By contrast, there are only 1,800 students enrolled in IT-related degrees in universities across town. The Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber is currently working with schools and students in grades K-12 to increase interest and awareness in information technology.

        <p>Cincinnati City Council unanimously rejected the state&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stand Your Ground&rdquo; laws in a vote last Wednesday. The restrictions on gun laws were introduced June 11 by two House Republicans and are aimed to loosen restrictions on the use of deadly force when a person has no option to retreat in a dangerous situation. Councilmembers insisted that Ohio already has strong enough laws to protect those who face physical harm from others. The bill would also loosen restrictions on concealed carry permits.

        <p>Cincinnati mayoral-candidate Roxanne Qualls and community partners unveiled their “Come Home Cincinnati” initiative, which is aimed at decreasing vacancy of dilapidated buildings and redevelop blighted neighborhoods.

In exchange, the loan on the property will be refinanced with the same or better interest rates within five years. The initiative will start with 100 properties in Walnut Hills and Evanston with plans to extend into Avondale, College Hill, Madisonville and other neighborhoods as program funds grow.

Allison and partners filed for the Dotloop trademark in 2011. The company faces another legal battle from the California Association of Realtors who claim Dotloop steals and alters their real estate forms.

        <p>The Cincinnati Bengals officially requested Hamilton County buy the team a new  $10 million scoreboard by the start of the 2014 NFL Stadium. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to the county -- an arrangement in the team’s lease stipulates if new technology such as a scoreboard is installed in at least 14 other NFL teams stadium’s, the county must foot the bill for a similar item if the Bengals request it. It’s unclear where Hamilton County officials will come up with the money for the scoreboard since they barely came up with the funds to balance the stadium fund this year which doesn’t include the scoreboard. If the county refuses to buy the scoreboard, the team could buy it themselves and bill the county for it at a later date.

According to The Cincinnati Enquirer, Chanh Luong, owner of the Escape Nail Spa in Hyde Park, was threatened and then beaten by his competitor John Nguyen who owns the Ambiance spa group. The incident occurred April 1 when Nguyen entered Escape Nail Spa and threatened Luong to remove a promotion or else.

        <p>With a decisive victory in the mayoral race on Tuesday, Mayor-elect John Cranley is ready to make good on his plan to dismantle the controversial streetcar project. To his credit, he's extending a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/11/06/cranley-well-find-an-alternative-to.html" target="_blank">public olive-branch</a> to streetcar enthusiasts and hopes to find a cheaper alternative that can achieve the same goals. While halting the efforts already underway will require a majority of support from the City Council, some members have <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/11/06/streetcar-fight-to-continue.html" target="_blank">nodded in agreement</a> with the new mayor's position.

        <p>In other Cranley news, Cincinnati neighborhoods may soon feel the sweet financial windfall of some new mayoral priorities. Chief among them, the bike trail on Wasson Way, a new interchange at I-71 &amp; MLK, and putting an end to the one-trash-can policy recently imposed on city residents. And not to be forgotten, OTR and the central business district downtown could see some changes to the controversial parking-lease plan as Cranley intends to cancel that too. Yep, our new mayor's got quite the laundry-list of stuff for his first term in office.

        <p>Cincinnati could soon be left without an abortion clinic due to restrictions passed in this summer&rsquo;s state budget. If that happens, Cincinnati would be the largest metropolitan area in the country without an abortion clinic, according to an analysis by The Cincinnati Enquirer. The restrictions stem from a rule that disallows abortion clinics to agree to a patient-transfer agreement with a taxpayer-funded hospital, which is forcing the clinics to find private hospitals for such agreements. Many private-funded hospitals are either religiously backed or won&rsquo;t enter agreements with abortion clinics.

The City of Cincinnati&rsquo;s offer to Saks of more than 100,000 square feet in complementary retail space was not enough to keep the retailer as a key anchor in plans for a revitalized retail district along Race Street.

Hamilton County Commissioners told the Museum Center that they won&rsquo;t approve their request for a $15 million per year tax levy until the repairs at Union Terminal are completed. Hamilton County Commissioner Greg Hartmann said the $180 million needed to fully repair Union Terminal needed to be reduced.

        <p>A lawsuit filed against Miami University is raising eyebrows about how universities should be held accountable for sexual assaults that happen on or near campus. A female Miami University student is charging the school with negligence after being raped in 2011. She says there were several red flags attributed to her attacker such as multiple instances reported by the Oxford police of “lewd sexual behavior” that should have resulted in his expulsion. This isn’t the first time the so-called Public Ivy university has come under fire for not portraying an environment of sexual safety. In 2012 a flier titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape” was circulated in MU’s freshman dorms, which resulted in the university being criticized for not publicizing the incident properly.

        <p>Should John Cranley get hit by a bus &mdash; his words, not ours &mdash; Councilman-elect David Mann will be the city&rsquo;s next mayor. Cranley announced recently that the 74-year-old Mann will be Cincinnati&rsquo;s next vice-mayor. Mann has a storied career in local Cincinnati politics having served on council from 1974&ndash;1992 and was mayor from 1980&ndash;1982.

        <p>In a move which will more than double its capacity and continue the rapid gentrification of OTR, the Drop Inn Center and downtown developer darling 3CDC have reached an agreement to move the largest homeless shelter to Queensgate. Barring some zoning restrictions, if the deal proceeds as planned, construction on the new site could begin as early as the second quarter of next year.

        <p>Hamilton County residents should be prepared to pay more for their water utility next year because rates will be climbing more than 20%. Additionally, Hamilton County Commissioners are mulling a 6% increase on sewer rates thanks to some federally mandated updates to Cincinnati's aging system, which in some cases is more than 100 years old.

        <p>Small surprise: Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has lost more flights than any other major U.S. airport while having some of the nation&rsquo;s fastest-climbing fares.

        <p>According to Chris Wetterich of the Business Courier, successful prospects for the Cincinnati streetcar are bleak at best. Making good on his campaign pledge to kill the project, newly elected Mayor John Cranley has ensured that all related ordinances moving through the council include appropriations, thereby placing the opposition momentum right outside the realm of public referendum. Further complicating matters, the federal government has frozen the project’s grant and a major funding organization is <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/12/02/foundation-may-yank-music-hall-park.html" target="_blank">now threatening to pull its money</a> from several city projects, including Smale Riverfront Park and a planned renovation of Music Hall.

According to recent divorce filings, Deters was not living at the residence as early as July. Deters maintains his full compliance with the law and stipulates that he voted on November 5th from his downtown residence.

        <p>The long battle over whether or not Cincinnati would get a streetcar seemed to come to a conclusion yesterday with City Council voting to pause development on the project until a financial audit determines if it makes sense to complete the first phase of development.

Mallory grew up in the West End and was raised by his working-class parents before being elected to the Ohio House in 1966 and staying in the seat for 28 years. Mallory&rsquo;s sons said their father instilled in them a sense of civic duty as all five contributed to their father&rsquo;s political successes. One of Mallory&rsquo;s biggest achievements was a lawsuit that struck-down the at-large voting system, which diluted black voting power and prevented blacks from becoming elected judges.

        <p>Cincinnati Public School&rsquo;s experiment to save the district from losing millions of dollars has so far been a resounding success, according to Assistant Superintendent Gabe Lofton. The savings came from enacting an open enrollment program that allows students who live outside of the Cincinnati Public School district limits to attend a CPS school. As a result of enrolling, $5,700 comes with the student to the district. More than 800 out-of-district students applied for open-enrollment this school year and about 600 were accepted and are currently attending more than 20 CPS schools. Before open enrollment students who wanted attend a CPS school had to pay a tuition fee.

        <p>After the brief honeymoon of hopeful City Manager Willie Carden came to an end this week, City Council appointed interim City Manager Scott Stiles Wednesday to the post. But the move didn&rsquo;t come without it&rsquo;s fair share of controversy with some council members concerned with Stiles&rsquo; updated compensation package that raises Stiles&rsquo; annual salary to $240,000. If the city chooses someone other than Stiles to be the permanent city manager, Stiles would be demoted to an assistant city manager with a salary of $180,000, which is $30,000 more than the other assistant city manager. If on the other hand the theoretical permanent city manager relieves Stiles of his duty completely, the city is obligated to pay Stiles some form of salary until 2018, which allows Stiles to collect his full pension payment upon retirement.

        <p>While Mayor Cranley has repeatedly and publicly expressed his fervent opposition to the streetcar, his passion for the MLK interchange has to some, represented a double standard. At Monday's council meeting, members posed some of the same questions to supporters of the interchange as were lobbied at streetcar proponents. Among them, whether the maintenance costs for the interchange will be paid by the city vs. private funds, whether the project will affect property tax rates and what is the overall economic impact of the project.

        <p>A Cincinnati City Council Budget Committee effectively voted to prevent the city from lowering property taxes as planned by unanimously approving the allocation of $20 million in capital funding to the Martin Luther King Drive and Interstate 71 interchange project. The $106-million project is expected to produce somewhere between 5,900 and 7,300 jobs in and around the uptown area. The property tax savings to residents would have been an annual $10 per $100,000 home valuation after 2017.

        <p>More than 36,000 Ohioans could lose unemployment benefits in December if Congress doesn&rsquo;t vote to extend emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed past Dec. 28. Another 128,600 would lose benefits in 2014 if Congress doesn&rsquo;t take action on the issue. The benefits currently cost the country more than $25 billion a year and would sustain or create more than 310,000 jobs by allowing the unemployed to buy goods and services.

        <p>During Sunday's loss to the Pittsburg Steelers, Bengals punter Kevin Huber suffered a hit that will force him onto the sidelines for the remainder of the season. As a result of the hit by Steelers linebacker Terrance Garvin, which many have deemed wholly unnecessary, Huber sustained a broken jaw and cracked vertebrae in his neck. Garvin is expected to be fined by the NFL this week.

        <p>The Cincinnati Enquirer has an in-depth story about what&rsquo;s at stake for the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline that&rsquo;s designed to carry natural gas liquids through Kentucky into refining facilities in the northeastern United States. The controversial project is slated to be up and running by 2015 and is set to pay out more than $140 million in easement payments to Ohio residents and another $40 million to those in Kentucky. The proposed route for the pipeline is pitting neighbor against neighbor and carries with it a range of environmental concerns, including risk for explosion or spilling. About 6,000 to 7,000 temporary jobs will be created during construction of the pipeline.

        <p>A lot has happened in the last few days regarding the city&rsquo;s most controversial project. The financial audit came back yesterday and shows that cancelling the streetcar will cost $50 to $80 million while continuing will cost roughly $70 million. While the report appears to have swayed at least one swing vote on the council, Mayor Cranley has vowed to veto any ordinance allowing the project to continue. A final decision is expected today, as the deadline to secure federal grants expires at midnight tonight. And be sure to stop by the Senate for their dog of the day: The &ldquo;John Cranley&rdquo; - plain hotdog on a bun with no reasoning behind it.

        <p>It&rsquo;s getting close to the time to make New Year&rsquo;s resolutions and Gov. Kasich made a number of them for Ohio in 2014. The governor&rsquo;s wish list includes increasing funding for infrastructure projects in Ohio, new anti- poverty measures and a possible tax cut. Kasich needs to do something to curb state unemployment because Ohio has experienced several months of stagnant job growth and currently ranks 43rd in the nation for job growth rate during the past 12 months. Kasich also said Ohio has an image problem and has teamed up with L Brands CEO Les Wexner to brainstorm a marketing plan for the state.

        <p>Only 57 percent of students in Cincinnati are considered &ldquo;ready for kindergarten,&rdquo; according to education-focused Strive Partnership&rsquo;s executive director Greg Landsman. Landsman is heading up a new initiative called Preschool Promise that hopes to provide a preschool education to all local children. Landsman estimated it would take between $15-17 million per year to send all 3- and 4-year-old children in the city to preschool. The project still has far to go, however, and is currently exploring funding options such as private donations, a new property or income tax and having CPS appropriate money to the project.

        <p>Real estate developer Matt Daniels took the stand Tuesday and Wednesday to answer questions about his role in the bungled Kenwood Towne Place project. Daniels faces 23 counts of fraud, including being accused of defrauding Bank of America by providing false information for the construction loan. Daniels, who was paid a salary of $225,000, told the courtroom that he wished he would have given the project &ldquo;more time.&rdquo; The project is now under active development under the name the Kenwood Collection and is set to open in 2016.

        <p>Candace Klein&rsquo;s SoMoLend will likely be liquidated before it faces a Jan. 23 hearing where it is being accused of securities fraud. Klein and her partners are accused of selling unregistered securities and making false financial projections. Investors in SoMoLend accused the state of Ohio of causing the venture to fail because of a bias against crowd-funded ventures and possible investor fraud associated with such investments.

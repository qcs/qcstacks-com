City Council plans to ask a judge for $12 million from a former convention center and hotel project that has since been forgotten.

This comes in contrast to previous years when these riders were allowed to board after just a short period of time. Parents are pissed.

        <p>Do you often find yourself short of ammo after firing 31 rounds from a semi-automatic weapon? If so, you might be in luck. State Rep. John Becker of Union Township introduced a bill in the Ohio House that changes the definition of semi-automatic firearms to no longer qualify them as automatic firearms, therefore skirting the law of a magazine holding a maximum of 31 rounds of ammunition. Proponents of the bill say stopping to reload after 31 shots takes too much time. To put things in perspective: Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooter, had several 30-round magazines.

        <p>As the on-going struggle to resolve the national health-care crisis continues, a majority of Ohioans have reported support for an expansion of Medicaid in the state. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, states are now obligated to comply with the expansion to the tune of 10 percent of the cost after the first three years. Conservative state legislators have signaled some concern over the long-term viability of federal support and have thus far been reluctant to embrace the expansion.

        <p>21c is looking to attract more foodies by offering outdoor dining in the alleyway between the hotel and neighboring Nicholson’s tavern. The city seems poised to grant the deal this week which would clear the way for diners to enjoy their meals outdoors as early as this summer.

        <p>Following a flurry of activity around the city’s parking lease deal, Hamilton County Court of Appeals ruled last week that the legislation is not subject to public referendum. Thus, the door to making the controversial deal official was opened&mdash; prompting City Manager Milton Dohoney to sign on the dotted line this past Monday. While the exact terms of the final deal could be shifted by City Council, Mayor Mallory squashed a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2013/06/19/mayor-mallory-thwarts-parking-lease.html">last ditch effort</a> at repeal by disapproving council members yesterday.

        <p>Hamilton County Commissioner Chris Monzel and Councilman Chris Seelbach announced a deal today that should lift a hold on county funds dedicated to fixing the city's aging sewer system. As a condition, city council will rework the "responsible bidder" legislation passed last month that requires contractors to establish and fund accredited apprenticeship programs.

        <p>Last week, the controversy surrounding the city’s decision to lease parking meters to the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority was officially put to rest. On Monday, City Manager Milton Dohoney signed the lease and on Friday, chairman of the Port Authority board Otto Budig did the same. The result is no less than 30 years of managed parking assets for the city, netting $92 million upfront and at least $3 million annually moving forward.

        <p>Things are looking up for the city’s controversial streetcar plan. Just yesterday, city council narrowly approved $17.4 million in funds for the project.

        <p>Building by building, Over the Rhine is slowly inching back to its brewing roots. Rhinegeist Brewing joins Christian Moerlein as yet another microbrewery in Cincinnati when it opens its doors to the public this Saturday, June 29. Rhinegeist will have four beers on tap at its opening and will primarily focus on West Coast-style beers that play up citrusy, hoppy and tropical flavors. The brewery plans to start canning 16-ounce beers in the fall, but in the meantime visitors can pick up 32- or 64-ounce growlers.

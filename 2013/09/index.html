        <p>While the housing market continues to post healthy numbers, the recent downturn in mortgage refinancing has had an unfortunate impact on banking employees in the state.

        <p>Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble joined other Fortune 500 companies last week when it sponsored legislation ending workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There is no law currently on the books that penalizes or limits a workplace from refusing to hire or firing someone based on their sexuality. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act has strong bipartisan support and is supported by many small businesses.

        <p>Lunken Airport missed out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in improvements due to poor management and technology problems, according to an audit by the city&rsquo;s Citizen Complaint and Internal Audit department. Among the findings, the city failed to collect landing fees that totaled $120,000 and is owed $420,000 for six years of back rent from the Metropolitan Sewer Department. Despite the losses, Lunken remains in the black and generated $2.1 million in revenue last year.

        <p>The city&rsquo;s impending pension crisis comes to a head today, as City Council will take up a vote on whether to place a pension-altering charter amendment on the ballot this fall. Previously opposed by a large majority of the council, the ballot initiative comes by way more than 8,000 petition signatures collected by the Cincinnati for Pension Reform Committee. The group proposes replacing the current pension system with 401k-style retirement accounts for all new employees after the end of the year.

        <p>Persistent opponents of the city&rsquo;s recent decision to lease its parking assets is making more legal waves this week, albeit with not much success. The Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST) was denied an appeal yesterday by the Ohio Supreme Court for its first judicial effort in the matter. And this morning, COAST argues before Hamilton County Common Pleas that the current version of the lease has changed enough to warrant another vote. If found to be true, the ruling could jeopardize the entire plan as a majority of council members have since changed their tunes.

        <p>The executive director of the Cincinnati Retirement System has raised some new concerns over the forthcoming efforts to reform city pension plans. The amendment to move new city employees into 401k-style retirement accounts has been officially approved as a ballot initiative for this fall. If passed by voters, the change could have some significant implications on employees, such as their ability to deduct pre-tax contributions before paying federal income taxes.

ArtWorks saw this as an opportunity and will begin the process of converting the old advertising spaces to canvases for local artists. Ryan Little, the lead artist for ArtWorks, and apprentices aged 14-to-21 will design the art that will be placed on the shelters.

        <p>Hamilton County voters might be out of their tax rebate they were promised when they voted to approve the two riverfront stadiums in 1996. According to a 2019 stadium fund plan, decreased sales taxes contributed to the stadium fund rebate being reduced from the original 30 percent tax rollback approved by voters. The tax rollback could be further reduced or entirely eliminated if the Bengals request a new scoreboard by 2019.

        <p>Bolstered by increasing cell-phone thefts over the past few years, City Councilman Chris Seelbach is calling for increased regulation of after-market cell-phone sales in the city. The goal is to make dealers who regularly buy and sell used phones register with the city and keep track of all related transactions. Seelbach introduced legislation aimed at the effort last week in partnership with the Cincinnati Police Department.

Councilmembers insisted that Ohio already has strong enough laws to protect those who face physical harm from others. The bill would also loosen restrictions on concealed carry permits.

        <p>John Cranley and Roxanne Qualls squared off in their first post-primary mayoral debate Tuesday, which featured both candidates disagreeing sharply on both the streetcar project and the city&rsquo;s parking lease deal. Cranley maintains the city promotes controversial and risky moves such as the streetcar at the expense of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods in favor of downtown. Qualls says Cincinnati&rsquo;s investment in its core is central to bringing growth to downtown and the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods. Cranley is fiercely opposed to the streetcar project and in favor of a trackless trolley system instead.

        <p>Now where are we going to shop? Hoity-toity downtown residents might soon be out of luck if the owners of the embattled Kenwood Collection get their way by luring luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue out of downtown. The long-stalled Kenwood project is looking to attract upscale retailers such as Saks to anchor its reboot. Since 1996 the city of Cincinnati has given Saks a total of $8.7 million for renovations to keep the retailer downtown.

        <p>Hamilton County Juvenile Court Judge Tracy Hunter has four weeks to act on six outstanding cases or will be cited for contempt by an appeals court. According to Hamilton County Public Defender Ray Faller, Hunter&rsquo;s failure to act on cases was preventing children from being adopted, getting out of juvenile jail and delays in finding long-term foster care for children. The possible punishment for contempt is 30 days in jail and/or a $250 fine per case.

        <p>Toni Morrison responded to Ohio School Board President Debe Tehar’s comments calling the author’s novel The Bluest Eye “pornographic” by calling the president’s statements ironic considering Morrison herself is from Ohio. Tehar suggested any mention of the novel be dropped from Ohio’s new Common Core education standards because its storyline follows a young girl from Lorain, Ohio whose father rapes and impregnates her. The American Civil Liberties Union responded by writing a scolding letter to Tehar.

        <p>Cincinnati mayoral-candidate Roxanne Qualls and community partners unveiled their “Come Home Cincinnati” initiative, which is aimed at decreasing vacancy of dilapidated buildings and redevelop blighted neighborhoods. Owner-occupants of the empty buildings have to meet minimum credit requirements, promise to live in the properties for at least five years, and finance 5 percent of the total rehab costs as down payment. In exchange, the loan on the property will be refinanced with the same or better interest rates within five years. The initiative will start with 100 properties in Walnut Hills and Evanston with plans to extend into Avondale, College Hill, Madisonville and other neighborhoods as program funds grow.

Upon investigation, they discovered a victim, bleeding profusely and struggling to cross the street. Thanks to the councilman&rsquo;s quick response, emergency personnel whisked the man away to the hospital where he&rsquo;s expected to recover.

        <p>Cincinnati-based startup Dotloop has been hit with a lawsuit for copyright infringement and a cease-and-desist letter for using a Realtor&rsquo;s association&rsquo;s forms in its software. Dotloop, which started in 2008 as MLS Contracts, is being sued by LoopNet, an online real estate marketplace, who maintains Dotloop&rsquo;s CEO Austin Allison was well aware of the name dispute as Allison was a registered member of LoopNet. Allison and partners filed for the Dotloop trademark in 2011. The company faces another legal battle from the California Association of Realtors who claim Dotloop steals and alters their real estate forms.

The lawsuit could potentially net more than $19 million in payments to former gym members. The lawsuit alleges Urban Active of failing to honor cancellation notices, misrepresenting terms on contracts and other shady business practices. Anyone who signed a contract with Urban Active between Jan. 1, 2006 and Oct. 26, 2012 is eligible to a payout.

        <p>Based on an analysis done by a former Procter &amp; Gamble Co. executive, the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority could receive more than $230 million during the next 40 years as a result of its deal to lease Cincinnati’s parking assets. The City of Cincinnati estimates to see an up-front $85-million payment plus an additional yearly amount ranging between $3 million and $19 million until 2053. The executive who completed the analysis, said he believes the city could have generated an additional $80 million if they kept the parking system and made the technological improvements themselves.

        <p>Speaking of election day, Cincinnati Blog recently posted a relevant <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQmuJlvLpvE" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> depicting Councilman Chris Smitherman making some “wild and outlandish” claims. According to the blog, Smitherman has a history or making ridiculous statements and this is just another example, as many of his claims cannot be substantiated. Why is this relevant you ask? Mayoral candidate John Cranley reportedly posted this video to his Facebook page as a measure of his support for Smitherman.

The publications&rsquo; offices sit on the bottom floor of the former department store and has the Landor branding agency as its neighbors. Landor recently hosted a &ldquo;Shillito&rsquo;s Abandoned&rdquo; benefit in support of Covington&rsquo;s Mike Amman, the owner of BLDG who is battling cancer. Check out for some spooky photos from the abandoned department store.

        <p>With a decisive victory in the mayoral race on Tuesday, Mayor-elect John Cranley is ready to make good on his plan to dismantle the controversial streetcar project.

        <p>In other Cranley news, Cincinnati neighborhoods may soon feel the sweet financial windfall of some new mayoral priorities. Chief among them, the bike trail on Wasson Way, a new interchange at I-71 &amp; MLK, and putting an end to the one-trash-can policy recently imposed on city residents. And not to be forgotten, OTR and the central business district downtown could see some changes to the controversial parking-lease plan as Cranley intends to cancel that too. Yep, our new mayor's got quite the laundry-list of stuff for his first term in office.

Probably not, but the development corporation known for being a key player in the Over-the-Rhine transformation recently purchased the former Butternut bread factory from Hostess. 3CDC has been mum on their plans for the factory, but it could be related to their Queensgate plans, which include a new City Gospel Mission building in the area.

        <p>Cincinnati could soon be left without an abortion clinic due to restrictions passed in this summer&rsquo;s state budget. If that happens, Cincinnati would be the largest metropolitan area in the country without an abortion clinic, according to an analysis by The Cincinnati Enquirer. The restrictions stem from a rule that disallows abortion clinics to agree to a patient-transfer agreement with a taxpayer-funded hospital, which is forcing the clinics to find private hospitals for such agreements. Many private-funded hospitals are either religiously backed or won&rsquo;t enter agreements with abortion clinics.

While some may view this move with abject skepticism, officials managing the project have clarified that the plan has nothing to do with very public political opposition waged by incoming Mayor John Cranley during his campaign.

The interchange project at I-71 and MLK was slated to be one of the chief benefactors, as the parking deal would've provided almost 20% of the total budget for that project.

The City of Cincinnati&rsquo;s offer to Saks of more than 100,000 square feet in complementary retail space was not enough to keep the retailer as a key anchor in plans for a revitalized retail district along Race Street.

The project is slated to receive $44.9 million from three separate federal grants, which Cranley had hope to reuse for other projects such as the Western Hills Viaduct.

        <p>Bike enthusiasts' wheels must be turning thanks to a new proposed bikeway connecting Northside to Downtown. With all the neighborhoods in between also benefitting, the project will convert one lane of Central Parkway, running in either direction for bike-only use. The funds for the work come courtesy of a state grant; work will start in the summer of 2014.

        <p>Cincinnati Museum Center might never have to go back to voters asking for a tax levy if it weren&rsquo;t for the constant repairs its home at Union Terminal requires. Unfortunately those repairs to the aging Union Terminal add up quickly and both the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County often quibble about who is on the hook for paying for the fixes. Hamilton County Commissioners told the Museum Center that they won&rsquo;t approve their request for a $15 million per year tax levy until the repairs at Union Terminal are completed. Hamilton County Commissioner Greg Hartmann said the $180 million needed to fully repair Union Terminal needed to be reduced.

        <p>Cincinnati's standing within the LGBT community has improved over the last year according it's score on the Municipal Equality Index, a measure compiled and released by the Human Rights Campaign. The score, which reflects the city's support of LGBT citizens who live and work here, was computed for municipalities across the country. Cincinnati scored 90 out of a possible 100, with the only impediment to a perfect score being lack of a domestic partner registry that supports LGBT relationships.

        <p>Economists are casting a bleak outlook on the city's economic development and employment prospects next year. According to the 2014 Regional Economic Outlook, Cincinnati will be outpaced by national averages and should brace for only modest gains in job growth. While the immediate news seems somewhat disappointing, regional leaders remain optimistic; the numbers are better than last year and represent a 5 year high, by all measures.

        <p>Much to the chagrin of Ohio prosecutors and police chiefs, Ohioans might soon be able to use deadly force in public as an act of self defense. Commonly referred to as “stand your ground laws,” a House committee approved gun legislation that recognizes concealed-carry licenses in other states and extended the use of deadly force outside of a person’s home or vehicle if acting in self-defense. The law is expected to go to the entire House for debate soon.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-29093-restricted_responsibility.html">Miami University Sued for Negligence after Sexual Assault</a></h2>
        <p>A lawsuit filed against Miami University is raising eyebrows about how universities should be held accountable for sexual assaults that happen on or near campus. A female Miami University student is charging the school with negligence after being raped in 2011. She says there were several red flags attributed to her attacker such as multiple instances reported by the Oxford police of “lewd sexual behavior” that should have resulted in his expulsion. This isn’t the first time the so-called Public Ivy university has come under fire for not portraying an environment of sexual safety. In 2012 a flier titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape” was circulated in MU’s freshman dorms, which resulted in the university being criticized for not publicizing the incident properly.

        <p>This morning, Councilman PG Sittenfeld held a press conference where he declared a change of heart on the streetcar and is now supportive of allowing the first phase of the project to be completed. This decision comes in the wake of a <a href="http://wvxu.org/post/another-streetcar-vote-after-conference-call-federal-lawyer" target="_blank">conference call</a> with Federal counsel who, in no uncertain terms, stipulated that even pausing the project at this point would result in immediate debt collection and reallocation of funds to other parts of the state. Mayor Cranley, who's first term in office starts next week, maintains his staunch vow to stymie the effort.

        <p>Hamilton County residents should be prepared to pay more for their water utility next year because rates will be climbing more than 20%. Additionally, Hamilton County Commissioners are mulling a 6% increase on sewer rates thanks to some federally mandated updates to Cincinnati's aging system, which in some cases is more than 100 years old.

        <p>Small surprise: Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport has lost more flights than any other major U.S. airport while having some of the nation&rsquo;s fastest-climbing fares. The study, conducted by USA Today, analyzed changes in flights, seats and fares from 2005 - 2013. During that time, CVG lost 78 percent of flights. The same time period saw average fares increase 26 percent.

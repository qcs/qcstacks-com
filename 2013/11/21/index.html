        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/blog-5287-cincinnatis_equality_index_score_improves.html">Queen City Supports LGBT Equality</a></h2>
        <p>Cincinnati's standing within the LGBT community has improved over the last year according it's score on the Municipal Equality Index, a measure compiled and released by the Human Rights Campaign. The score, which reflects the city's support of LGBT citizens who live and work here, was computed for municipalities across the country. Cincinnati scored 90 out of a possible 100, with the only impediment to a perfect score being lack of a domestic partner registry that supports LGBT relationships.

        <p>Economists are casting a bleak outlook on the city's economic development and employment prospects next year. According to the 2014 Regional Economic Outlook, Cincinnati will be outpaced by national averages and should brace for only modest gains in job growth. While the immediate news seems somewhat disappointing, regional leaders remain optimistic; the numbers are better than last year and represent a 5 year high, by all measures.

        <p>Much to the chagrin of Ohio prosecutors and police chiefs, Ohioans might soon be able to use deadly force in public as an act of self defense. Commonly referred to as “stand your ground laws,” a House committee approved gun legislation that recognizes concealed-carry licenses in other states and extended the use of deadly force outside of a person’s home or vehicle if acting in self-defense. The law is expected to go to the entire House for debate soon.

        <h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/article-29093-restricted_responsibility.html">Miami University Sued for Negligence after Sexual Assault</a></h2>
        <p>A lawsuit filed against Miami University is raising eyebrows about how universities should be held accountable for sexual assaults that happen on or near campus. A female Miami University student is charging the school with negligence after being raped in 2011. She says there were several red flags attributed to her attacker such as multiple instances reported by the Oxford police of “lewd sexual behavior” that should have resulted in his expulsion. This isn’t the first time the so-called Public Ivy university has come under fire for not portraying an environment of sexual safety. In 2012 a flier titled “Top Ten Ways to Get Away with Rape” was circulated in MU’s freshman dorms, which resulted in the university being criticized for not publicizing the incident properly.
